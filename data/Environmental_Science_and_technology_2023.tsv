In the history of human-made macromolecules, WSPs have consistently portrayed a crucial role and served as the ingredients of a variety of products (e.g., flocculants, thickeners, solubilizers, surfactants, etc.) commonly used in human society. However, the environmental exposures and risks of WSPs with different functions remain poorly understood. This paper provides a critical review of the usage, environmental fate, environmental persistence, and biological consequences of multiple types of WSPs in commercial and industrial production. Investigations have identified a wide market of applications and potential environmental threats of various types of WSPs, but we still lack the suitable assessment tools. The effects of physicochemical properties and environmental factors on the environmental distribution as well as the transport and transformation of WSPs are further summarized. Evidence regarding the degradation of WSPs, including mechanical, thermal, hydrolytic, photoinduced, and biological degradation is summarized, and their environmental persistence is discussed. The toxicity data show that some WSPs can cause adverse effects on aquatic species and microbial communities through intrinsic toxicity and physical hazards. This review may serve as a guide for environmental risk assessment to help develop a sustainable path for WSP management."

CCR components include fine particulate material, minerals, and trace elements such as mercury, arsenic, selenium, lead, etc., which can have deleterious effects on ecosystem functioning and public health. Effects on communities can occur through consumption of drinking water, fish, and other aquatic organisms. The structural failure of impound-ments, water infiltration, leakage from impoundments due to poor construction and monitoring, and CCR effluent discharges to water bodies have in the past resulted in harmful environmental impacts. Moreover, the risks posed by CCRs are present to this day, as coal continues to account for 11% of the energy production in the United States. In this Critical Review, the legacy of CCR disposal and the concomitant risks posed to public health and ecosystems are assessed. The resiliency of CCR disposal sites in the context of increased frequency and intensity of storm events and other hazards, such as floods and earthquakes, is also evaluated. We discuss the current state of knowledge on the environmental fate of CCR-derived elements, as well as advances in and limitations of analytical tools, which can improve the current understanding of CCR environmental impacts in order to mitigate the associated risks. An assessment of the 2015 Coal Ash Final Rule is also presented, along with needs to improve monitoring of CCR disposal sites and regulatory enforcement."

Water was collected from urban and rural rivers around Dhaka, Bangladesh, and analyzed by liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry in four ionization modes (electrospray ionization +/-, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization +/-) with data -independent MS2 acquisition. The acquisition strategy was complementary: 19,427 and 7365 features were unique to ESI and APCI, respectively. The complexity of water pollution was revealed by >26,000 unique molecular features resolved by MS-DIAL, among which >20,000 correlated with urban sources in Dhaka. A major wastewater treatment plant was not a dominant pollution source, consistent with major contributions from uncontrolled urban drainage, a result that encourages development of further wastewater infrastructures. Matching of deconvoluted MS2 spectra to public libraries resulted in 62 confident annotations (i.e., Level 1-2a) and allowed semiquantification of 42 analytes including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and personal care products. In silico structure prediction for the top 100 unknown molecular features associated with an urban source allowed 15 additional chemicals of anthropogenic origin to be annotated (i.e., Level 3). The authentic MS2 spectra were uploaded to MassBank Europe, mass spectral data were openly shared on the MassIVE repository, a tool (i.e., MASST) that could be used for community science environmental surveillance was demonstrated, and current limitations were discussed."

Existing technology allows in situ automated measurements of water quality constituents, including both solutes and particulates, at unprecedented frequencies from seconds to subdaily sampling intervals. This detailed chemical information can be combined with measurements of hydrological and biogeochemical processes, bringing new insights into the sources, transport pathways, and transformation processes of solutes and particulates in complex catchments and along the aquatic continuum. Here, we summarize established and emerging high-frequency water quality technologies, outline key high-frequency hydrochemical data sets, and review scientific advances in key focus areas enabled by the rapid development of high-frequency water quality measurements in streams and rivers. Finally, we discuss future directions and challenges for using high-frequency water quality measurements to bridge scientific and management gaps by promoting a holistic understanding of freshwater systems and catchment status, health, and function."

Under physiological conditions, HSA helped to disperse PNs but promoted the formation of aggregates in the presence of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA, Delta Dh = 135 nm) and S (TBBPS, Delta Dh = 256 nm) at pH 7. At pH 4, these aggregates became larger with fewer electrostatic repulsion effects (Delta Dh = 920 and 691 nm for TBBPA and TBBPS, respectively). However, such promotion effects as well as BFR binding are different due to structural differences of tetrabromobisphenol A and S. Environmental kosmotropes efficiently stabilized the structure of HSA and inhibited BFR binding, while the chaotropes favored bioconjugated aggregate formation. Such effects were also verified in natural seawater. The newly gained knowledge may help us anticipate the behavior and fate of plastic particles and small molecular pollutants in both physiological and natural aqueous systems."

We herein highlighted a recently developed top-down bioanalytical method, protein Affinity Purification with Nontargeted Analysis (APNA), to screen for bioactive chemical contaminants at the exposome-wide level. To achieve this, a tagged functional protein is employed as a bait to directly isolate bioactive chemical contaminants from environmental mixtures, which are further identified by nontargeted analysis. Advantages of this protein-guided approach, including the discovery of new bioactive ligands as well as new protein targets for known chemical contaminants, were highlighted by several case studies. Encouraged by these successful applications, we further proposed a framework, i.e., the environmental Chemical-Protein Interaction Network (eCPIN), to construct a complete map of the 7 billion binary interactions between all chemical contaminants (> 350,000) and human proteins (similar to 20,000) via APNA. The eCPIN could be established in three stages through strategically prioritizing the similar to 20,000 human proteins, such as focusing on the 48 nuclear receptors (e.g., thyroid hormone receptors) in the first stage. The eCPIN will provide an unprecedented throughput for screening bioactive chemical contaminants at the exposome-wide level and facilitate the identification of molecular initiating events at the proteome-wide level."

Class 1 integrons are genetic elements that correlate strongly with anthropogenic pollution and contribute to the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes via HGT. Despite their significance to human health, there is a shortage of robust, culture free surveillance technologies for identifying uncultivated environmental taxa that harbor class 1 integrons. We developed a modified version of epicPCR (emulsion, paired isolation, and concatenation polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) that links class 1 integrons amplified from single bacterial cells to taxonomic markers from the same cells in emulsified aqueous droplets. Using this single-cell genomic approach and Nanopore sequencing, we successfully assigned class 1 integron gene cassette arrays containing mostly AMR genes to their hosts in coastal water samples that were affected by pollution. Our work presents the first application of epicPCR for targeting variable, multigene loci of interest. We also identified the Rhizobacter genus as novel hosts of class 1 integrons. These findings establish epicPCR as a powerful tool for linking taxa to class 1 integrons in environmental bacterial communities and offer the potential to direct mitigation efforts toward hotspots of class 1 integron-mediated dissemination of AMR."

To assess such trade-offs, discipline-specific models typically used in isolation need to be integrated to support decisions. Integrated modeling approaches, however, usually remain at the conceptual level, and operationalization efforts are lacking. Here, we propose an integrated model and framework to guide the assessment and engineering of technical, socio-economic, and environmental aspects of low-carbon technologies. The framework was tested with a case study of design strategies aimed to improve the material sustainability of electric vehicle batteries. The integrated model assesses the trade-offs between the costs, emissions, material criticality, and energy density of 20,736 unique material design options. The results show clear conflicts between energy density and the other indicators: i.e., energy density is reduced by more than 20% when the costs, emissions, or material criticality objectives are optimized. Finding optimal battery designs that balance between these objectives remains difficult but is essential to establishing a sustainable battery system. The results exemplify how the integrated model can be used as a decision support tool for researchers, companies, and policy makers to optimize low-carbon technology designs from various perspectives."

Among 767 gene expression profiles covering 81 environmental compounds, 11 priority compounds are identified with the greatest effects on the cardiovascular system at the transcriptional level. Among them, metals (AgNO3, Ag nanoparticles, arsenic) and pesticides/biocides (linuron, methylparaben, triclosan, and trimethylchlorotin) are identified with the most significant effects. Distinct transcriptional signatures are further identified by the percentage values, indicating that different physiological endpoints exist among prioritized compounds. In addition, cardiovascular dysregulations are experimentally confirmed for the prioritized compounds via alterations of cardiovascular physiology and lipid profiles of zebrafish. The accuracy rate of experimental verification reaches up to 62.9%.

Important data gaps exist regarding the structures, reaction mechanisms, and environmental occurrence of TPs from 6PPD ozonation. To address these data gaps, gas-phase ozonation of 6PPD was conducted over 24-168 h and ozonation TPs were characterized using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The probable structures were proposed for 23 TPs with 5 subsequently standard-verified. Consistent with prior findings, 6PPDQ (C18H22N2O2) was one of the major TPs in 6PPD ozonation (similar to 1 to 19% yield). Notably, 6PPDQ was not observed during ozonation of 6QDI (N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N '-phenyl-p-quinonediimine), indicating that 6PPDQ formation does not proceed through 6QDI or associated 6QDI TPs. Other major 6PPD TPs included multiple C18H22N2O and C18H22N2O2 isomers, with presumptive N-oxide, N,N '-dioxide, and orthoquinone structures. Standard-verified TPs were quantified in roadway-impacted environmental samples, with total concentrations of 130 +/- 3.2 mu g/g in methanol extracts of tire tread wear particles (TWPs), 34 +/- 4 mu g/g-TWP in aqueous TWP leachates, 2700 +/- 1500 ng/L in roadway runoff, and 1900 +/- 1200 ng/L in roadway-impacted creeks. These data demonstrate that 6PPD TPs are an and class of contaminants in environments."

However, how bacterial communication organizes the entire community for anaerobes to cope with varied anaerobic-aerobic conditions remains unclear. We constructed a local bacterial communication gene (BCG) database comprising 19 BCG subtypes and 20279 protein sequences. BCGs in anammox-partial nitrification consortia coping with intermittent aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well as gene expressions of 19 species were inspected. We found that when suffering oxygen changes, intra-and interspecific communication by a diffusible signal factor (DSF) and bis-(3 '- 5 ')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) changed first, which in turn induced changes of autoinducer-2 (AI-2)-based interspecific and acyl homoserine lactone (AHLs)-based intraspecific communication. DSF and c-di-GMP-based communication regulated 455 genes, which covered 13.64% of the genomes and were mainly involved in antioxidation and metabolite residue degradation. For anammox bacteria, oxygen influenced DSF and cdi-GMP-based communication through RpfR to upregulate antioxidant proteins, oxidative damage-repairing proteins, peptidases, and carbohydrate-active enzymes, which benefited their adaptation to oxygen changes. Meanwhile, other bacteria also enhanced DSF and c-di-GMP-based communication by synthesizing DSF, which helped anammox bacteria survive at aerobic conditions. This study evidences the role of bacterial communication as an organizer within consortia to cope with environmental changes and sheds light on understanding bacterial behaviors from the perspective of sociomicrobiology."

Power-to-hydrogen (PtH2) technologies based on clean electricity can provide such H2, yet their carbon intensities alone do not provide sufficient basis to judge their potential contribution to a sustainable and just energy transition. Introducing a prospective life cycle assessment frame-work to decipher the non-linear relationships between future technology and energy system dynamics over time, we showcase its relevance to inform research, development, demonstration, and deployment by comparing two PtH2 technologies to steam methane reforming (SMR) across a series of environmental and resource-use metrics. We find that the system transitions in the power, cement, steel, and fuel sectors move impacts for both PtH2 technologies to equal or lower levels by 2100 compared to 2020 per kg of H2 except for metal depletion. The decarbonization of the United States power sector by 2035 allows PtH2 to reach parity with SMR at 10 kg of CO2e/kg H2 between 2030 and 2050. Updated H2 radiative forcing and leakage levels only marginally affect these results. Biomass carbon removal and storage power technologies enable carbon-negative H2 after 2040 at about -15 kg of CO2e/kg H2. Still, both PtH2 processes exhibit higher impacts across most other metrics, some of which are worsened by the decarbonization of the power sector. Observed increases in metal depletion and eco-and human toxicity levels can be reduced via PtH2 energy and material use efficiency improvements, but the power sector decarbonization routes also warrant further review and cradle-to-grave assessments to show tradeoffs from a systems perspective."

Waste electronic products containing brominated flame retardants can cause serious secondary pollution, which is why catalytic cracking, adsorption, fixation, separation, and purification have gained significant attention. However, the bromine resources have not been effectively reutilized. The application of advanced pyrolysis technology could help solve this problem via converting bromine pollution into bromine resources. Coupled debromination and bromide reutilization during pyrolysis is an important field of research in the future. This prospective paper presents new insights in terms of the reorganization of different elements and adjustment of bromine phase transition. Furthermore, we proposed some research directions for efficient and environmentally friendly debromination and reutilization of bromine: 1) precise synergistic pyrolysis should be further explored for efficient debromination, such as using persistent free radicals in biomass, polymer hydrogen supply, and metal catalysis, 2) rematching of Br elements and nonmetal elements (C/H/O) will be a promising direction for synthesizing functionalized adsorption materials, 3) oriented control of the bromide migration path should be further studied to obtain different forms of bromine resources, and 4) advanced pyrolysis equipment should be well developed."

Here we analyze air quality, human health, and freshwater conservation co-benefits of decarbonizing the energy supply of 850 China's industrial parks. We examine a clean energy transition including early retirement of coal-fired facilities and subsequent replacement with grid electricity and onsite energy alternatives (municipal solid waste-to-energy, rooftop photovoltaic, and distributed wind power). We find that such a transition would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 41% (equal to 7% of 2014 national CO2 equivalent emissions); emissions of SO2 by 41%, NOx by 32%, and PM2.5 by 43% and freshwater consumption by 20%, relative to a 2030 baseline scenario. Based on modeled air pollutant concentrations, we estimate such a clean energy transition will result in similar to 42,000 avoided premature deaths annually due to reduced ambient PM2.5 and ozone exposure. Costs and benefits are monetized including technical costs of changes in equipment and energy use and societal benefits resulting from improvements in human health and reductions of climate impacts.

This study evaluated the life cycle environmental impacts of emerging EO technology from laboratory scale to industrial scale using prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) on a quantitative basis. Environmental impacts of EO technology were assessed at laboratory scale by comparing three representative anode materials (SnO2, PbO2, and boron-doped diamond) and other two typical processes (adsorption and Fenton method), which verified the competitiveness of the EO process and identified the key factors to environmental hotspots. Thereafter, LCA of scale-up EO was performed to offer guidance for practical application, and the life cycle inventory was compiled upon thermodynamic and kinetic simulations, empirical calculation rules, and similar technical information. Results demonstrated EO to be effective for destructing recalcitrant organic pollutants, but visible direct benefits might be outweighed by increased indirect environmental burdens associated with the preparation of anode materials, use of electrolytes, and energy consumption during the operation stage at both laboratory scale and larger scale. This necessitated attention to overall life cycle profiles by taking into account reactor design, anode materials, electrolyte and flow pattern, and decentralized location with a large share of renewable power station and rigorous contamination control strategies for wastewater treatment plants."

Phthalates are highly abundant plastic additives used primarily to soften materials and make them flexible, and biomonitoring shows widespread human exposure to a mixture of phthalates. Evidence supports biological additivity of phthalate mixture exposures, including the enhancement of toxicity affecting common biological targets. Risk estimates based on individual phthalate exposure may not be protective of public health. Thus, a cumulative risk approach is warranted. While EPA initially did not signal that it would incorporate cumulative risk assessment (CRA) as part of its current risk evaluation for the seven phthalates, the agency recently announced that it is reconsidering if CRA for phthalates would be appropriate. Based on our review of existing chemical mixtures risk assessment guidance, current TSCA scoping documents for the seven phthalates, and pertinent peer-reviewed literature, we delineate a CRA approach that EPA can easily implement for phthalates. The strategy for using CRA to inform TSCA risk evaluation for existing chemicals is based upon integrative physiology and a common adverse health outcome algorithm for identifying and grouping relevant nonchemical and chemical stressors. We recommend adjustments for how hazard indices (HIs) or margins of exposure (MOEs) based on CRA are interpreted for determining unreasonable risk under TSCA."

Desire to act is shared from the public to policymakers, yet motivation and approaches are diverging. Public attention is directed to reducing plastic consumption, cleaning local environments, and engaging in citizen science initiatives. Policymakers and regulators are working on prevention and mitigation measures, while international, regional, and national bodies are defining monitoring recommendations. Research activities are focused on validating approaches to address goals and comparing methods. Policy and regulation are eager to act on plastic pollution, often asking questions researchers cannot answer with available methods. The purpose of monitoring will define which method is implemented. A clear and open dialogue between all actors is essential to facilitate communication on what is feasible with current methods, further research, and development needs. For example, some methods can already be used for international monitoring, yet limitations including target plastic types and sizes, sampling strategy, available infrastructure and analytical capacity, and harmonization of generated data remain. Time and resources to advance scientific understanding must be balanced against the need to answer pressing policy issues."

However, there is little information characterizing the toxic potency of PFECHS to zebrafish embryos and its potential for effects in aquatic environments. This study assessed toxic potency of PFECHS in vivo during both acute (96-hour postfertilization) and chronic (21-day posthatch) exposures and tested concentrations of PFECHS from 500 ng/L to 2 mg/L. PFECHS was less likely to cause mortalities than PFOS for both the acute and chronic experiments based on previously published values for PFOS exposure, but exposure resulted in a similar incidence of deformities. Exposure to PFECHS also resulted in significantly increased abundance of transcripts of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (ppar alpha), cytochrome p450 1a1 (cyp1a1), and apolipoprotein IV (apoaIV) at concentrations nearing those of environmental relevance. Overall, these results provide further insight into the safety of an emerging PFAS alternative in the aquatic environment and raise awareness that previously considered safer alternatives may show similar effects as legacy PFASs."

Some plant species are able to hyperaccumulate REEs, and understanding the biology behind this phenomenon could play a pivotal role in developing more environmentally friendly REE recovery technologies. Here, we identified a REE transporter NRAMP REE Transporter 1 (NREET1) from the REE hyperaccumulator fern Dicranopteris linearis. Although NREET1 belongs to the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP) family, it shares a low similarity with other NRAMP members. When expressed in yeast, NREET1 exhibited REE transport capacity, but it could not transport divalent metals, such as zinc, nickel, manganese, or iron. NREET1 is mainly expressed in D. linearis roots and predominantly localized in the plasma membrane. Expression studies in Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that NREET1 functions as a transporter mediating REE uptake and transfer from root cell walls into the cytoplasm. Moreover, NREET1 has a higher affinity for transporting light REEs compared to heavy REEs, which is consistent to the preferential enrichment of light REEs in field-grown D. linearis. We therefore conclude that NREET1 may play an important role in the uptake and consequently hyperaccumulation of REEs in D. linearis. These findings lay the foundation for the use of synthetic biology techniques to design and produce sustainable, plant-based REE recovery systems."

However, the high-efficiency electrogeneration of middotOH remains challengeable, as it is difficult to synchronously obtain efficient catalysis of both reaction steps above on one catalytic site. In this work, we propose a dual-atomic-site catalyst (CoFe DAC) to cooperatively catalyze middotOH electrogeneration, where the atomically dispersed Co sites are assigned to enhance O2 reduction to H2O2 intermediates and Fe sites are responsible for activation of the as-generated H2O2 to middotOH. The CoFe DAC delivers a higher middotOH production rate of 2.4 mmol L-1 min-1 gcat -1 than the single-site catalyst Co-NC (0.8 mmol L-1 min-1 gcat -1) and Fe-NC (1.0 mmol L-1 min-1 gcat -1). Significantly, the CoFe DAC hetero-e-Fenton process is demonstrated to be more energy-efficient for actual coking wastewater treatment with an energy consumption of 19.0 kWh kg-1 COD-1 than other electrochemical technologies that reported values of 29.7 similar to 68.0 kW h kg-1 COD-1. This study shows the attractive advantages of efficiency and sustainability for middotOH electrogeneration, which should have fresh inspiration for the development of new-generation wastewater treatment technology."

Phototrophic biofilms growing at the soil-water interface in periodically flooding-drying soils like paddy fields consume and produce DOM during their growth and decomposition. However, the effects of phototrophic biofilms on DOM remain poorly understood in these settings. Here, we found that phototrophic biofilms transformed DOM similarly despite differences in soil types and initial DOM compositions, with stronger effects on DOM molecular composition than soil organic carbon and nutrient contents. Specifically, growth of phototrophic biofilms, especially those genera belonging to Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, increased the abundance of labile DOM compounds and richness of molecular formulae, while biofilm decomposition decreased the relative abundance of labile components. After a growth and decomposition cycle, phototrophic biofilms universally drove the accumulation of persistent DOM compounds in soil. Our results revealed how phototrophic biofilms shape the richness and changes in soil DOM at the molecular level and provide a reference for using phototrophic biofilms to increase DOM bioactivity and soil fertility in agricultural settings."

Hydroxylation of the catalytic surface provides a new strategy for regulating the catalytic activity to boost VOC degradation. Herein, OZCO of toluene at room temperature over hydroxyl-mediated MnOx/Al2O3 catalysts was originally demonstrated. Specifically, a novel hydroxyl mediated MnOx/Al2O3 catalyst was developed via the in situ AlOOH reconstruction method and used for toluene OZCO. The toluene degradation performance of MnOx/Al2O3 was significantly superior to those of most of the state-of-the-art catalysts, and 100% toluene was removed with an excellent mineralization rate (82.3%) and catalytic stability during OZCO. ESR and in situ DRIFTs results demonstrated that surface hydroxyl groups (HGs) greatly improved the reactive oxygen species generation, thus dramatically accelerating the benzene ring breakage and deep mineralization. Furthermore, HGs provided anchoring sites for uniformly dispersing MnOx and greatly enhanced toluene adsorption and ozone activation.

Quantification was conducted via combustion ion chromatography (C-IC). Hydrogen chloride (HCl) was quantitatively released from PVC during thermal decomposition and trapped in an absorption solution. Selectivity of the marker HCl in complex environmental samples was ensured using cleanup via pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) with methanol at 100 degrees C (discarded) and tetrahydrofuran at 185 degrees C (collected). Using this method, recoveries of 85.5 +/- 11.5% and a limit of quantification down to 8.3 mu g/g were achieved. A variety of hard and soft PVC products could be successfully analyzed via C-IC with recoveries exceeding >95%. Furthermore, no measurable overdetermination was found for various organic and inorganic matrix ingredients, such as sodium chloride, sucralose, hydroxychloroquine, diclofenac, chloramphenicol, triclosan, or polychlorinated biphenyls. In addition, sediments and suspended particular matter showed PVC concentrations ranging up to 16.0 and 220 mu g/g, respectively. However, the gap between determined polymer mass and particle masses could be significant since soft PVC products contain plasticizers up to 50 wt %. Hence, the results of the described method represent a sum of all chlorine containing polymers, which are extractable under the chosen conditions."

Among the DOM results, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, and activated carbon showed optimal performance due to the characteristics of processes and the compound properties. However, the risks of low-molecular-weight organic residue and byproduct formation are still present. Thirty-nine species of synthetic organic compounds (SOC) were qualitatively and semiquantitatively analyzed. Different technologies showed varying removal capabilities for SOC based on their properties and many substances coexisted leading to abnormal removal performances. These residual organics showed the characteristics of lower molecular weight, more hydrophilicity, further unknown impacts, and with risk of DBPs.

This study analyzed the spatial nonstationarity in the associations between toxic chemical hazard risk and community characteristics of census block groups in Texas, USA, for 2017 using a multiscale geographically weighted regression. The results showed that the percentage of Black or Asian population has significant positive associations with toxic risk across block groups in Texas, meaning that racial minorities suffered more from toxic risk wherever they are located in the state. By contrast, the percentage of Hispanic or Latino has a positive relationship with toxic risk, and the relationship varies locally and is only significant in eastern areas of Texas. Statistical associations between toxic risk and socioeconomic variables are not stationary across the state, showing sub-state patterns of spatial variation in terms of the sign, significant level, and magnitude of the coefficient. Income has a significant negative association with toxic risk around the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington Metropolitan Statistical Area. Proportions of people without high school diploma and the unemployment rate both have positive relationships with toxic risk in the eastern area of Texas. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying the spatial patterns of the association between toxic chemical hazard risks and community characteristics at the census block group level for addressing environmental inequality."

However, the occurrence of PPDs and TPs in recycled tire rubber products remains uncharacterized. Here, we analyzed tire wear particles (TWPs), recycled rubber doormats, and turf-field crumb rubbers for seven PPD antioxidants, five PPD-quinones (PPDQs), and five other 6PPD TPs using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. PPD antioxidants, PPDQs, and other TPs were present in all samples with chemical profiles dominated by 6PPD, DTPD, DPPD, and their corresponding PPDQs. Interestingly, the individual [PPDQ]/[PPD] and [TP]/[PPD] ratios significantly increased as total concentrations of the PPD-derived chemical decreased, indicating that TPs (including PPDQs) dominated the PPD-derived compounds with increased environmental weathering. Furthermore, we quantified 15 other industrial rubber additives (including bonding agents, vulcanization accelerators, benzotriazole and benzothiazole derivatives, and diphenylamine antioxidants), observing that PPD-derived chemical concentrations were 0.5-6 times higher than these often-studied additives. We also screened various other elastomeric consumer products, consistently detecting PPD-derived compounds in lab stoppers, sneaker soles, and rubber garden hose samples. These data emphasize that PPD antioxidants, PPDQs, and related TPs are important, previously overlooked contaminant classes in tire rubbers and elastomeric consumer products."

In recent years, it has become common to use machine learning models to fill gaps in monitoring data. However, it remains unclear how well these models are able to capture spikes in PM2.5 during and across wildfire events. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of two sets of high-coverage and high-resolution machine learning-derived PM2.5 data sets created by Di et al. and Reid et al. In general, the Reid estimates are more accurate than the Di estimates when compared to independent validation data from mobile smoke monitors deployed by the US Forest Service. However, both models tend to severely under-predict PM2.5 on high-pollution days. Our findings complement other recent studies calling for increased air pollution monitoring in the western US and support the inclusion of wildfire-specific monitoring observations and predictor variables in model-based estimates of PM2.5. Lastly, we call for more rigorous error quantification of machine-learning derived exposure data sets, with special attention to extreme events."

In this study, we confirm that 6 -week-old Geobacter spp. dominated biofilms are by far more active and stable in AD-effluents than 3-week-old Geobacter spp. dominated biofilms. Furthermore, we show that the biofilms are twice as active at -0.2 V compared to 0.4 V, even under challenging conditions occurring in AD -MET systems. Paired-end amplicon sequencing at the DNA level using 16S-rRNA and mcrA gene shows that hydrogenotrophic methanogens incorporate into biofilms immersed in AD-effluent without any negative effect on biofilm stability and electrochemical activity."

This study presents a MESSAGEix-CAEP model to explore Chinese decarbonization pathways and their cost-benefit under two mitigation scenarios by establishing connections between five energy-intensive sectors based on energy and material flows. The results indicated the following: 1) Interaction and feedback between sectors should not be disregarded. The electrification process of the other four sectors was projected to increase electricity production by 206%, resulting in a higher power demand than current forecasts. 2) The marginal abatement cost to achieve carbon neutrality across all five sectors was 2189 CNY/tCO2, notably higher than current Chinese carbon emission trading prices. 3) The cost-benefit analysis indicates that a more ambitious abatement strategy would decrease the marginal abatement cost and result in a higher net carbon abatement benefit. The cumulative net benefit of carbon reduction was 7.8 trillion CNY under ambitious mitigation scenario, 1.3 trillion CNY higher than that under current Chinese mitigation scenario. These findings suggest that policy-makers should focus on the interaction effects of decarbonization pathways between sectors and strengthen their decarbonization efforts to motivate early carbon reduction."

However, how environmental aging, an inevitable process once NPs enter the environment, affects the formation of protein corona on NPs is still unclear. This study investigated the changes in the compositions of protein corona formed on photo-aged polystyrene (PS) NPs in human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), corresponding to the inhalation exposure pathway. The results demonstrated that both the species and abundance of proteins in the BALF protein corona on the surface of PS NPs were altered by aging. In addition, the aged PS NPs are more hydrophilic and less electronegative than the pristine PS NPs; hence, there is an increased sorption of more negatively charged hydrophilic proteins. Moreover, aging-induced alterations in BALF protein corona enhanced the uptake of aged PS NPs by lung macrophages J774A.1 through phagocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These findings highlight the importance of environmental aging processes in the biosafety assessment of nanoplastics."

Olivine has been proposed as a candidate mineral due to its abundance and high CO2 uptake potential. A life cycle assessment (LCA) of silt-sized (10 mu m) olivine revealed that CEW's life-cycle carbon emissions and total environmental footprint, i.e., carbon and environmental penalty, amount to around 51 kg CO2eq and 3.2 Ecopoint (Pt) units per tonne of captured atmospheric CO2, respectively, and these will be recaptured within a few months. Smaller particle sizes dissolve and uptake atmospheric CO2 even faster; however, their high carbon and environmental footprints (e.g., 223 kg CO2eq and 10.6 Pt tCO2-1, respectively, for 1 mu m olivine), engineering challenges in comminution and transportation, and possible environmental stresses (e.g., airborne and/or silt pollution) might restrict their applicability. Alternatively, larger particle sizes exhibit lower footprints (e.g., 14.2 kg CO2eq tCO2-1 and 1.6 Pt tCO2-1, respectively, for 1000 mu m olivine) and could be incorporated in coastal zone management schemes, thus possibly crediting CEW with avoided emissions. However, they dissolve much slower, requiring 5 and 37 years before the 1000 mu m olivine becomes carbon and environmental net negative, respectively. The differences between the carbon and environmental penalties highlight the need for using multi-issue life cycle impact assessment methods rather than focusing on carbon balances alone. When CEW's full environmental profile was considered, it was identified that fossil fuel dependent electricity for olivine comminution is the main environmental hotspot, followed by nickel releases, which may have a large impact on marine ecotoxicity. Results were also sensitive to transportation means and distance. Renewable energy and low-nickel olivine can minimize CEW's carbon and environmental profile."

However, quantitative analysis of the disproportionate impacts of emissions is rarely done due to a lack of suitable models. Our work develops a high-resolution reduced-complexity model (EASIUR-HR) to evaluate the disproportionate impacts of ground-level primary PM2.5 emissions. Our approach combines a Gaussian plume model for near-source impacts of primary PM2.5 with a previously developed reduced-complexity model, EASIUR, to predict primary PM2.5 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 300 m across the contiguous United States. We find that lowresolution models underpredict important local spatial variation of air pollution exposure to primary PM2.5 emissions, potentially underestimating the contribution of these emissions to national inequality in PM2.5 exposure by more than a factor of 2. We apply EASIUR-HR to analyze the impacts of vehicle electrification on exposure disparities. While such a policy has small aggregate air quality impacts nationally, it reduces exposure disparity for race/ethnic minorities. Our high-resolution RCM for primary PM2.5 emissions (EASIUR-HR) is a new, publicly available tool to assess inequality in air pollution exposure across the United States."

The impacts of morphology on MONP dissolution are largely uncertain due to the lack of in situ tracking techniques. In this study, we combined a series of in situ technologies including liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence probes to reveal the in situ dissolution process of Cu2O NPs in freshwater. Our results suggest that cubic Cu2O NPs exhibit a higher dissolution quantity compared with spherical NPs of the same surface area. The difference was mainly related to the crystal surface, while other factors such as particle size or aggregation status showed minor effects. Importantly, we demonstrated the simultaneous growth of new small NPs and the dissolution of pristine Cu2O NPs during the dissolution of Cu2O NPs. Cubic Cu2O NPs became much less soluble under O2-limited conditions, suggesting that O2 concentration largely affected the dependence of dissolution on the NP morphology. Our findings highlight the potential application of in situ techniques to track the environmental fates of MONPs, which would provide important information for assessing the ecological risks of engineered NPs."

Motivated by animal welfare considerations, we developed a decision tree to minimize in vivo fish testing for such legacy active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The minimum no observed effect concentration (NOECmin, the lowest NOEC from chronic Daphnia and algal toxicity studies), the theoretical therapeutic water concentration (TWC, calculated using the fish plasma model), and the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) were used to derive API risk quotients (PEC/NOECmin and PEC/TWC). Based on a verification data set of 96 APIs, we show that by setting a threshold value of 0.001 for both risk quotients, the need for in vivo fish testing could potentially be reduced by around 35% without lowering the level of environmental protection. Hence, for most APIs, applying an assessment factor of 1000 (equivalent to the threshold of 0.001) to NOECmin substituted reliably for NOECfish, and TWC acted as an effective safety net for the others. In silico and in vitro data and mammalian toxicity data may further support the final decision on the need for fish testing."	"[Brown, A.

Therefore, an integrated strategy of biochar-assisted catalytic pyrolysis (BCP) of OS and residue utilization for soil reclamation is investigated in this study. During the catalytic pyrolysis process, biochar as a catalyst intensifies the removal of recalcitrant petroleum hydrocarbons at the expense of liquid product yield. Concurrently, biochar as an adsorbent can inhibit the release of micromolecular gaseous pollutants (e.g. HCN, H2S, and HCl) and stabilize heavy metals. Due to the assistance of biochar, pyrolysis reactions of OS are more likely to occur and require a lower temperature to achieve the same situation. During the soil reclamation process, the obtained residue as a soil amendment can not only provide a carbon source and mineral nutrients but can also improve the abundance and diversity of microbial communities. Thus, it facilitates the plant germination and the secondary removal of petroleum hydrocarbons. The integrated strategy of BCP of OS and residue utilization for soil reclamation is a promising management strategy, which is expected to realize the coordinated and benign disposal of more than one waste."

The results indicated that the O2 tension for loss of equilibrium (LOE) decreased from 1.17 to 0.66 mg/L after 4 weeks of IHE. Meanwhile, the red blood cell (RBC) and hemoglobin concentrations significantly increased during IHE. Our investigation also found that the observed increase in angiogenesis was correlated with a high expression of related regulators, such as Jagged, phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). After 4 weeks of IHE, the overexpression of factors related to angiogenesis processes mediated by HIF-independent pathways (such as nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B), NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), and interleukin 8 (IL8)) was correlated with the accumulation of lactic acid (LA) in the liver. The addition of cabozantinib, a specific inhibitor of VEGFR2, blocked the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and downregulated the expression of downstream angiogenesis regulators in largemouth bass hepatocytes exposed to hypoxia for 4 h. These results suggested that IHE promoted liver vascular remodeling by the regulation of angiogenesis factors, presenting a potential mechanism for the improvement of hypoxia tolerance in largemouth bass."

However, limited efforts have been made to characterize pharmaceuticals in MSW landfill refuse, which is also of significant concern given the potential long-term environmental impact. Herein, we excavated landfill refuse from six cells with landfill ages of 7-27 years in the largest MSW landfill in Shanghai (in each cell, landfill refuse was collected from different depths of 2-8 m) and analyzed samples for the presence of 55 pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics and non-antibiotics. The results reveal the presence of 42 pharmaceuticals in landfill refuse, with median concentrations ranging from 0.30 to 116 mu g/kg. Antibiotic and non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals exhibited diverse concentration trends with age, related to changes in policy intervention and consumption over time. Different concentration variations of individual pharmaceuticals were observed in refuse samples excavated at different depths and positively correlated to their sorption ability. The mass of pharmaceuticals in the investigated landfill was estimated from the obtained concentrations to be 80-220 tons with 95% probability, based on Monte Carlo analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first estimate of pharmaceutical mass in an MSW landfill.

"Is Additive Manufacturing an Environmentally and Economically Preferred Alternative for Mass Production?"

Across multiple industries, AM has been used to reduce material use in final parts by 35-80%, and recent publications have predicted that AM will enable the fabrication of customized products locally and on-demand, reducing shipping and material waste. In many contexts, however, AM is not a viable alternative to traditional manufacturing methods due to its high production costs. And in high-volume mass production, AM can lead to increased energy use and material waste, worsening environmental impacts compared to traditional production methods. Whether AM is an environmentally and economically preferred alternative to traditional manufacturing depends on several hidden aspects of AM that are not readily apparent when comparing final products, including energy-intensive and expensive material feedstocks, excessive material waste during production, high machine costs, and slow rates of production. We systematically review comparative studies of the environmental impacts and costs of AM in contrast with traditional manufacturing methods and identify the conditions under which AM is the environmentally and economically preferred alternative. We find that AM has lower production costs and environmental impacts when production volumes are relatively low (below similar to 1,000 per year for environmental impacts and below 42-87,000 per year for costs, depending on the AM process and part geometry) or the parts are small and would have high material waste if traditionally manufactured. In cases when the geometric freedom of AM enables performance improvements that reduce environmental impacts and costs during a product's use phase, these can counteract the higher production impacts of AM, making it the preferred alternative at larger production volumes. AM's ability to be environmentally and economically beneficial for mass manufacturing in a wider variety of contexts is dependent on reducing the cost and energy intensity of material feedstock production, eliminating the need for support structures, raising production speeds, and reducing per unit machine costs. These challenges are not primarily caused by economies of scale, and therefore, they are not likely to be addressed by the increasing expansion of the AM sector. Instead, they will require fundamental advances in material science, AM production technologies, and computer-aided design software."

The most intriguing questions are related to quantitative assessment of human health and ecological risks of exposure to the critical substances via natural or induced artificial groundwater discharge: What is the list of critical substances released from discharging groundwater, and what are the pathways of the receptors' exposure to the critical substances? How to quantify the flux of critical substances during groundwater discharge? What procedures can we follow to assess human health and ecological risks of groundwater discharge?

Here, we systematically investigate this cascaded plastic waste processing over other waste end-of-life management pathways by analyzing the environmental consequences of plastic losses across the entire life cycle. Plastic losses can form volatile organic chemicals via photo degradation and pose non-negligible global warming, ecotoxicity, and air pollution effects that worsen by at least 189% in the long run. These environmental burdens increase by above 9.96% under high ultraviolet radiation levels and participation rates, which facilitate plastic particulate compartment transport and degradation.

However, the microbiome and virome assemblages in FS after chemical and biological treatments remain unclear. Here, we reported the differences in the solid reduction and microbiomes of FS subjected to potassium ferrate (PF), alkali (ALK), and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) pretreatments and anaerobic digestion (AD). The PF and NaClO pretreatments enhanced FS hydrolysis and pathogen suppression, respectively; AD suppressed Grampositive bacteria. Most of the viromes were those of bacteriophages, which were also shaped by chemical pretreatments and AD. Metatranscriptome analysis revealed distinct gene expression patterns between the PF-and ALK-pretreated FS and the subsequent AD. Differentially expressed gene profiles indicated that genes related to biological processes, molecular functions, and transcriptional regulators were upregulated in ALK-AD and PF-AD samples. These findings suggested that the effect of different treatment technologies on the viral diversity, pathogen abundance, and metabolic function of the core microbiome extends beyond FS decomposition and that the use of combined processes would provide possible alternatives for FS management in pandemic emergencies."

To explore the effects of PM on the risk of GHDs and their progression among pregnant women with natural or ART conception, we enrolled 185,140 pregnant women during 2014-2020 in Shanghai and estimated the associations during different periods using multivariate logistic regression. During the 3 months of preconception, 10 mu g/m3 increases in PM concentrations were associated with increased risks of gestational hypertension (GH) (PM2.5: aOR = 1.076, 95% CI: 1.034-1.120; PM10: aOR = 1.042, 95% CI: 1.006-1.079) and preeclampsia (PM2.5: aOR = 1.064, 95% CI: 1.008-1.122; PM10: aOR = 1.048, 95% CI: 1.006-1.092 ) among women with natural conception. Furthermore, for women with ART conceptions who suffered current GHD, 10 mu g/m3 increases in PM concentrations in the third trimester elevated the risk of progression (PM2.5: aOR = 1.156, 95% CI: 1.022-1.306 ; PM10: aOR = 1.134, 95% CI: 1.013-1.270). In summary, women with natural conception should avoid preconceptional PM exposure to protect themselves from GH and preeclampsia. For women with ART conceptions suffering from GHD, it is necessary to avoid PM exposure in late pregnancy to prevent the disease from progressing."

Spatially refined estimation of built environment stocks benefits city management, for example, in urban mining and resource circularity strategy making. Nighttime light (NTL) data sets are widely used and are regarded as high-resolution products in large-scale building stock research. However, some of their limitations, especially blooming/ saturation effects, have hampered performance in estimating building stocks. In this study, we experimentally proposed and trained a convolution neural network (CNN)-based building stock estimation (CBuiSE) model and applied it to major Japanese metropolitan areas to estimate building stocks using NTL data. The results show that the CBuiSE model is capable of estimating building stocks at a relatively high resolution (approximately 830 m) and reflecting spatial distribution patterns, although the accuracy needs to be further improved to enhance the model performance. In addition, the CBuiSE model can effectively mitigate the overestimation of building stocks arising from the blooming effect of NTL. This study highlights the potential of NTL to provide a new research direction and serve as a cornerstone for future anthropogenic stock studies in the fields of sustainability and industrial ecology."

Little is known about how monitoring network design features, including the number of stops and sampling temporality, impacts exposure assessment models. We address this gap by leveraging an extensive mobile monitoring campaign conducted in the greater Seattle area over the course of a year during all days of the week and most hours. The campaign measured total particle number concentration (PNC; sheds light on ultrafine particulate (UFP) number concentration), black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and carbon dioxide (CO2). In Monte Carlo sampling of 7327 total stops (278 sites x 26 visits each), we restricted the number of sites and visits used to estimate annual averages. Predictions from the all-data campaign performed well, with cross-validated R2s of 0.51-0.77. We found similar model performances (85% of the all-data campaign R2) with similar to 1000 to 3000 randomly selected stops for NO2, PNC, and BC, and similar to 4000 to 5000 stops for PM2.5 and CO2. Campaigns with additional temporal restrictions (e.g., business hours, rush hours, weekdays, or fewer seasons) had reduced model performances and different spatial surfaces.

The anti-poisoning capacities, including the resistance against factors of H2O, SO2, and alkali/alkaline/heavy metals, are also achieved, which presents strong environmental practicability for treating NOx in flue gas.

In this work, we investigate factors impacting the differences between an individual's true (unobserved) exposure to air pollution and the exposure reported by their nearest AQ instrument (which could be either an LCS or an EPA monitor). We use simulations based on California data to explore different combinations of hypothetical LCS placement strategies (e.g., at schools or near major roads), for different numbers of LCS, with varying plausible amounts of LCS device measurement errors. We illustrate how real-time AQ reporting could be improved (or, in some cases, worsened) by using LCS, both for the population overall and for marginalized communities specifically.

The mechanisms of DOM molecular assembly on mineral surfaces have been extensively studied at the mesoscale with equilibrium experiments, yet the molecular-level evolution of the DOM-mineral interface under dynamic interaction conditions is not fully understood. Here, we designed a microfluidic reactor coupled with an online solid phase extraction (SPE)-LC-QTOF MS system to continually monitor the changes in DOM composition during flowing contact with Fe oxyhydroxide at circumneutral pH, which simulates soil minerals interacting with constant DOM input. Time-series UV-visible absorption spectra and mass spectrometry data showed that after aromatic DOM moieties were first preferentially sequestered by the pristine Fe oxyhydroxide surface, the adsorption of nonaromatic DOM molecules with greater hydrophobicity, lower acidity, and lower molecular weights (<400) from new DOM solutions was favored. This is accompanied by a transition from mineral surface chemistry-dominated adsorption to organic-organic interaction dominated adsorption. These findings provide direct molecular-level evidence to the zonal model of DOM assembly on mineral surfaces by taking the dynamics of interfacial interactions into consideration. This study also shows that coupled microfluidics and online high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) system is a promising experimental platform for probing microscale environmental carbon dynamics by integrating in situ reactions, sample pretreatment, and automatic analysis."

However, today's chlorinated drinking water is not unambiguously safe; trace levels of regulated and unregulated disinfection byproducts (DBPs), and other known, unknown, and emerging contaminants (KUECs), present chronic risks that make them essential removal targets. Because conventional chemicalbased DWT processes do little to remove DBPs or KUECs, alternative approaches are needed to minimize risks by removing DBP precursors and KUECs that are ubiquitous in water supplies. We present the Minus Approach as a toolbox of practices and technologies to mitigate KUECs and DBPs without compromising microbiological safety. The Minus Approach reduces problemcausing chemical addition treatment (i.e., the conventional Plus Approach) by producing biologically stable water containing pathogens at levels having negligible human health risk and substantially lower concentrations of KUECs and DBPs. Aside from ozonation, the Minus Approach avoids primary chemical-based coagulants, disinfectants, and advanced oxidation processes. The Minus Approach focuses on bank filtration, biofiltration, adsorption, and membranes to biologically and physically remove DBP precursors, KUECs, and pathogens; consequently, water purveyors can use ultraviolet light at key locations in conjunction with smaller dosages of secondary chemical disinfectants to minimize microbial regrowth in distribution systems. We describe how the Minus Approach contrasts with the conventional Plus Approach, integrates with artificial intelligence, and can ultimately improve the sustainability performance of water treatment. Finally, we consider barriers to adoption of the Minus Approach."

The key challenges for accelerating DAC deployment are its energy requirements, high capital costs, and finding lowrisk and low-cost sequestration or utilization pathways. Deploying DAC facilities proximal to sequestration or use sites and where the supply of low-cost renewable electricity is plentiful can minimize the energy, transportation, operational, and overall costs. Moreover, the increased 45Q tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 can further incentivize DAC deployment. This work provides a technoeconomic assessment of two configurations: temperature swing adsorption-based DAC and membrane-based DAC integrated for operation with wind energy in West Texas to provide proximal access to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations. We evaluate the levelized cost of DAC and the cumulative cost of sequestering a ton of CO2 through EOR to identify opportunities for economic viability. Finally, we determine the profitability of CO2 sequestration under different EOR recovery factors and oil prices. We find that opportunities to reduce costs through proximal sequestration, integration with renewable energy, and the current level of policy support in the US can significantly incentivize and rapidly accelerate the deployment of DAC, especially for membrane-based technologies."

In 2021, the World Health Organization established a new NO2 air quality guideline (AQG) (annual average <10 mu g/m3). However, the burden of diseases attributable to long-term NO2 exposure above the AQG is unknown in China. Nitrogen oxide is a major air pollutant in populous cities, which are disproportionately impacted by NO2; this represents a form of environmental inequality. We conducted a nationwide risk assessment of premature deaths attributable to long-term NO2 exposure from 2013 to 2020 based on the exposure-response relationship, high-resolution annual NO2 concentrations, and gridded population data (considering sex, age, and residence [urban vs rural]). We calculated health metrics including attributable deaths, years of life lost (YLL), and loss of life expectancy (LLE). Inequality in the distribution of attributable deaths and YLLs was evaluated by the Lorenz curve and Gini index. According to the health impact assessments, in 2013, long-term NO2 exposure contributed to 315,847 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 306,709-319,269) premature deaths, 7.90 (7.68-7.99) million YLLs, and an LLE of 0.51 (0.50-0.52) years. The high-risk subgroup (top 20%) accounted for 85.7% of all NO2-related deaths and 85.2% of YLLs, resulting in Gini index values of 0.81 and 0.67, respectively. From 2013 to 2020, the estimated health impact from NO2 exposure was significantly reduced, but inequality displayed a slightly increasing trend.

This work is focused on the impacts of a bilateral trade policy on ballast water-mediated nonindigenous species (NIS) spread risk. Taking the hypothetical Sino-US trade restriction as an example, we integrate a computable general equilibrium model and a higher-order NIS spread risk assessment model to examine the impacts of bilateral trade policy on both the economy and NIS spread risks. We have two important findings. First, the Sino-US trade restriction would cause decreases in NIS spread risks to China and the US, as well as to three quarters of worldwide countries/regions. However, the rest one fourth would experience increased NIS spread risks. Second, the relationship between changes in exports and changes in NIS spread risks might not be directly proportional. This is observed with 46% of countries and regions that would see their exports increase but their NIS spread risks drop, with positive impacts on both their economies and environment under the Sino-US trade restriction. These results reveal both broader global impacts as well as the decoupled economic and ecological impacts of a bilateral trade policy. These broader impacts demonstrate the necessity for national governments, which are parties to bilateral agreements to give due consideration to the economic and environmental impacts on countries and regions outside of the agreement."

Increasing demand for clean and safe water requires the rational design of UF membranes with antifouling potential, while maintaining high water permeability and removal efficiency. This work employed a machine learning (ML) method to establish and understand the correlation of five membrane performance indices as well as three major performance-determining membrane properties with membrane fabrication conditions. The loading of additives, specifically nanomaterials (A_wt %), at loading amounts of > 1.0 wt % was found to be the most significant feature affecting all of the membrane performance indices. The polymer content (P_wt %), molecular weight of the pore maker (M_Da), and pore maker content (M_wt %) also made considerable contributions to predicting membrane performance. Notably, M_Da was more important than M_wt % for predicting membrane performance. The feature analysis of ML models in terms of membrane properties (i.e., mean pore size, overall porosity, and contact angle) provided an unequivocal explanation of the effects of fabrication conditions on membrane performance. Our approach can provide practical aid in guiding the design of fitfor-purpose separation membranes through data-driven virtual experiments."

Herein, column transport experiments were used to measure air-water interfacial partitioning values for several perfluoroalkyl ethers and for PFASs derived from aqueous film-forming foam, while batch experiments were used to determine equilibrium Kia data for compounds exhibiting evidence of rate-limited partitioning. Experimental results suggest a Freundlich isotherm best describes PFAS air-water partitioning at environmentally relevant concentrations (101-106 ng/L). A multiparameter regression analysis for Kia prediction was performed for the 15 PFASs for which equilibrium Kia values were determined, assessing 246 possible combinations of 8 physicochemical and system properties. Quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs) based on three to four parameters provided predictions of high accuracy without model overparameterization. Two QSPRs (R2 values of 0.92 and 0.83) were developed using an assumed average Freundlich n value of 0.65 and validated across a range of relevant concentrations for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and hexafluoropropylene oxidedimer acid (i.e., GenX). A mass action model was further modified to account for the changing ionic strength on PFAS air-water interfacial sorption. The final result was two distinct QSPRs for estimating PFAS air-water interfacial partitioning across a range of aqueous concentrations and ionic strengths."

First, synchronous solvent-free ionization and in-source thermal desorption of CP homologues were achieved by the introduction of the PMO adsorbent-assisted APCI module, generating exclusive adduct ions ([M - H]-) of individual CP homologues (CnClm) with enhanced ionization efficiency. Improved detection limits of short-and medium-chain CPs (0.10-24 and 0.48-5.0 pg/mu L) were achieved versus those of the chloride-anion attachment APCI-MS methods. Second, the dual-purpose PMO probe was applied to extract the complex CP compositions in living animals, following APCI-FT-ICR-MS analysis. A modified pattern-deconvolution algorithm coupled with the sampling-rate calibration method was used for the quantification of CPs in living fish. In vivo quantification of a tilapia exposed to technical CPs for 7 days was successfully achieved, with n-ary sumation SCCPs and n-ary sumation MCCPs of the sampled fish calculated to be 1108 +/- 289 and 831 +/- 266 mu g/kg, respectively.

Membranes have also shown great promise for green separation. A majority of the investigations in the field are devoted to the membrane fabrication and modification with the ultimate goals of enhancing the properties and separation performance of membranes. However, less attention has been paid to membrane life cycle management, particularly at the end of service. This is becoming very important, especially taking into account the trends toward sustainable development and carbon neutrality. On the contrary, this can be a great opportunity considering the large variety of membrane processes, especially in terms of the size and capacity of plants in operation. This work aims to highlight the prominent aspects that govern membrane life cycle management with special attention to life cycle assessment (LCA). While fabrication, application, and recycling are the three key aspects of LCA, we focus here on membrane (module) recycling at the end of life by elucidating the relevant aspects, potential criteria, and strategies that effectively contribute to the achievement of green development and sustainability goals."

A common belief is that the enhanced performance is attributed to accelerated amine diffusion induced by the surfactant, which can promote the IP reaction. However, we show enhanced membrane performance for Tween 80 (a common surfactant), even though it decreased the amine diffusion. Indeed, the membrane performance is closely related to its polyamide roughness features with numerous nanovoids. Inspired by the nanofoaming theory that relates the roughness features to nano-bubbles degassed during the IP reaction, we hypothesize that the surfactant can stabilize the generated nanobubbles to tailor the formation of nanovoids. Accordingly, we obtained enlarged nanovoids when the surfactant was added below its critical micelle concentration (CMC). In addition, both the membrane permeance and selectivity were enhanced, thanks to the enlarged nanovoids and reduced defects in the polyamide layer. Increasing the concentration above CMC resulted in shrunken nanovoids and deteriorated performance, which can be ascribed to the decreased stabilization effect caused by micelle formation. Interestingly, better antifouling performance was also observed for the surfactant-assisted membranes. Our current study provides mechanistic insights into the critical role of surfactant during the IP reaction, which may have important implications for more efficient membrane-based desalination and water reuse."

Previous studies have attributed the strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity of riverine CH4 to environmental factors such as sediment type, water level, temperature, or particulate organic carbon abundance through correlation analysis. However, a mechanistic understanding of the basis for such heterogeneity is lacking. Here, we combine sediment CH4 data from the Hanford reach of the Columbia River with a biogeochemical-transport model to show that vertical hydrologic exchange flows (VHEFs), driven by the difference between river stage and groundwater level, determine CH4 flux at the sediment-water interface. CH4 fluxes show a nonlinear relationship with the magnitude of VHEFs, where high VHEFs introduce O2 into riverbed sediments, which inhibit CH4 production and induce CH4 oxidation, and low VHEFs cause transient reduction in CH4 flux (relative to production) due to reduced advective CH4 transport. In addition, VHEFs lead to the hysteresis of temperature rise and CH4 emissions because high river discharge caused by snowmelt in spring leads to strong downwelling flow that offsets increasing CH4 production with temperature rise. Our findings reveal how the interplay between in-stream hydrologic flux besides fluvial-wetland connectivity and microbial metabolic pathways that compete with methanogenic pathways can produce complex patterns in CH4 production and emission in riverbed alluvial sediments."

Both national and international regulations have been put in place over the last 20-30 years to eventually eliminate these compounds from the environment. One focus is the atmosphere, which acts as a major long-range transport route of these pollutants from their numerous sources to many ecosystems. This paper will ask, Have we have made any progress in eliminating insecticides from the atmosphere? We will focus only on the atmosphere around the North American Great Lakes and only on concentration measurements made once every 12 days since about 1990 for six classic insecticides. The answer is that some of these compounds (lindane, alpha-HCH, and endosulfans) are well on their way to being virtually eliminated, while the concentrations of others (DDT, chlordane, and hexachlorobenzene) have not changed much. We speculate that this difference in elimination is a result of soil compaction in cities (DDT, etc.) versus soil mixing in rural areas (lindane, etc.)."

Therefore, it entails novel noninvasive analytical approaches for in situ characterizing the formation and development of membrane fouling processes. This work presents a characterization approach based on hyperspectral light sheet fluorescence microscopy (HSPEC-LSFM), which is capable of discriminating various foulants and providing their 2-dimensional/3dimensional spatial distributions on/in membranes in a label-free manner. A fast, highly sensitive and noninvasive imaging platform was established by developing a HSPEC-LSFM system and further extending it to incorporate a laboratory-scale pressure-driven membrane filtration system. Hyperspectral data sets with a spectral resolution of similar to 1.1 nm and spatial resolution of similar to 3 mu m as well as the temporal resolution of similar to 8 s/plane were obtained, and the fouling formation and development process of foulants onto membrane surfaces, within the pores and on the pore walls were clearly observed during the ultrafiltration of protein and humic substances solutions. Pore blocking/constriction at short times while cake growth/concentration polarization at longer times was found to have coupled effects for the flux decline in these filtration tests, and yet the contribution of each effect as well as the transition of the governing mechanisms was found distinct. These results demonstrate in situ label-free characterization of membrane fouling evolution with the recognition of foulant species during filtration and provide new insights into membrane fouling.

Furthermore, bioaccumulation of PFAS in rice varieties -which is the essential staple food crop in Asia -has not been verified. Therefore, we cultivated Indica (Kasalath) and Japonica rice (Koshihikari) in the same Andosol (volcanic ash soil) paddy field and analyzed the air, rainwater, irrigated water, soil, and rice plants for 32 PFAS residues, throughout the cultivation to human consumption. During the rice cultivation period, the cultivation environment in atmospheric particulate matter (PM) constituted perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), with minimal perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs). Furthermore, perfluoroocta-nesulfonic acid (PFOS) migrates at a PM > 10 to drop in a cultivation field and was conducive to leakage and accumulation of PFCAs in air particles in the field environment. Moreover, precipitation was a sources of irrigation water contamination, and cultivated soil with a high carbon content could capture PFSAs and PFCAs (over C10). There were no major differences in residual PFAS trends in the rice varieties, but the distribution of PFAS in the growing soil, air, and rainwater differed.

Data on the nature and level of PFAS in residential environments are required to identify important pathways for human exposure. This work investigated important pathways of exposure to PFAS by reviewing, curating, and mapping evidence for the measured occurrence of PFAS in exposure media. Real-world occurrence for 20 PFAS was targeted primarily in media commonly related to human exposure (outdoor and indoor air, indoor dust, drinking water, food, food packaging, articles, and products, and soil). A systematic-mapping process was implemented to conduct title abstract and full-text screening and to extract PECO-relevant primary data into comprehensive evidence databases. Parameters of interest included the following: sampling dates and locations, numbers of collection sites and participants, detection frequencies, and occurrence statistics. Detailed data were extracted on PFAS occurrence in indoor and environmental media from 229 references and on PFAS occurrence in human matrices where available from those references. Studies of PFAS occurrence became numerous after 2005. Studies were most abundant for PFOA (80% of the references) and PFOS (77%). Many studies analyzed additional PFAS, particularly, PFNA and PFHxS (60% of references each). Food (38%) and drinking water (23%) were the commonly studied media. Most studies found detectable levels of PFAS, and detectable levels were reported in a majority of states in the United States. Half or more of the limited studies for indoor air and products detected PFAS in 50% or more of the collected samples. The resulting databases can inform problem formulation for systematic reviews to address specific PFAS exposure queries and questions, support prioritization of PFAS sampling, and inform PFAS exposure measurement studies. The search strategy should be extended and implemented to support living evidence review in this rapidly advancing area."

Understanding the electron transfer behavior between the electrodes and biofilm is crucial for the development of this technology. Herein, the electron transfer pathway of the biofilm and its catalytic capability that responded to the cathode potential during the electromethanogenesis process were investigated. The result suggested that the dominant electron transfer pathway shifted from a direct (DET) to indirect (IDET) way when decreasing the cathode potential from -0.8 V (Bio-0.8 V) to -1.0 V (Bio-1.0 V) referred to Ag/AgCl. More IDET-related redox substances and high content of hydrogenotrophic methanogens (91.9%) were observed at Bio-1.0 V, while more DET-related redox substances and methanogens (82.3%) were detected at Bio-0.8 V. H2, as an important electron mediator, contributed to the electromethanogenesis up to 72.9% of total CH4 yield at Bio-1.0 V but only similar to 17.3% at Bio-0.8 V. Much higher biogas upgrading performance in terms of CH4 production rate, final CH4 content, and carbon conversion rate was obtained with Bio-1.0 V.

The mineralization of aromatic VOCs requires the participation of a large number of oxygen atoms, so the activation of oxygen species is crucial in the degradation reaction. Herein, we originally adjust the Ce-O bond strength in CeZr oxide catalysts by cobalt doping to promote the activation of oxygen species, thus improving the toluene degradation performance while maintaining high stability. Subsequent characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the weakening of the Ce-O bond strength increases the oxygen vacancy content, promotes the activation of oxygen species, and enhances the redox ability of the catalysts. This strategy also promotes the activation of toluene and accelerates the depletion of intermediate species. This study will contribute a strategy to enhance the activation ability of oxygen species in non-noble metal oxide catalysts, thereby enhancing the degradation performance of VOCs."

Organisms and sunlight-mediated demethylation are well-known detoxification pathways of MeHg, yet whether abiotic environmental compo-nents contribute to MeHg degradation remains poorly known. Here, we report that MeHg can be degraded by trivalent manganese (Mn(III)), a naturally occurring and widespread oxidant. We found that 28 +/- 4% MeHg could be degraded by Mn(III) located on synthesized Mn dioxide (MnO2-x) surfaces during the reaction of 0.91 mu g center dot L-1 MeHg and 5 g center dot L-1 mineral at an initial pH of 6.0 for 12 h in 10 mM NaNO3 at 25 degrees C. The presence of low-molecular-weight organic acids (e.g., oxalate and citrate) substantially enhances MeHg degradation by MnO2-x via the formation of soluble Mn(III)-ligand complexes, leading to the cleavage of the carbon-Hg bond. MeHg can also be degraded by reactions with Mn(III)-pyrophosphate complexes, with apparent degradation rate constants comparable to those by biotic and photolytic degradation. Thiol ligands (cysteine and glutathione) show negligible effects on MeHg demethylation by Mn(III).

To address this knowledge gap, a kinetic model was developed to probe mechanisms of center dot OH production and reactivity with trichloroethene (TCE) and competing species in the presence of reduced iron minerals (RIM) and oxygen in batch experiments. RIM slurries were formed by combining different amounts of Fe(II) and sulfide (with Fe(II):S ratios from 1:1 to 50:1) or Fe(II) and sulfate with sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) added. Extents of TCE oxidation and center dot OH production were both greater with RIM prepared under more reducing conditions (more added Fe(II)) and then amended with O2. Kinetic rate constants from modeling indicate that center dot OH production from free Fe(II) dominates center dot OH production from solid Fe(II) and that TCE competes for center dot OH with Fe(II) and organic matter (OM). Competition with OM only occurs in experiments with SRB, which include cells and their exudates. Experimental results indicate that cells and/or exudates also provide electron equivalents to reform Fe(II) from oxidized RIM. Our work provides new insights into mechanisms and environmental significance of TCE oxidation by center dot OH produced from oxygenation of RIM. However, further work is necessary to confirm the relative importance of reaction pathways identified here and to probe potentially unaccounted for mechanisms that affect abiotic TCE oxidation in natural systems."

To achieve robust and sustainable disinfection with minimal adverse impacts, we developed Fe single-atom and Fe-Fe double-atom catalysts for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The Fe-Fe double-atom catalyst supported on sulfur-doped graphitic carbon nitride outperformed other catalysts for oxidation, and it activated PMS likely through a nonradical route of catalyst-mediated electron transfer. This Fe- Fe double-atom catalyst enhanced PMS disinfection kinetics for inactivating murine coronaviruses (i.e., murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59)) by 2.17-4.60 times when compared to PMS treatment alone in diverse environmental media including simulated saliva and freshwater. The molecular-level mechanism of MHV-A59 inactivation was also elucidated. Fe-Fe double-atom catalysis promoted the damage of not only viral proteins and genomes but also internalization, a key step of virus lifecycle in host cells, for enhancing the potency of PMS disinfection. For the first time, our study advances double-atom catalysis for environmental pathogen control and provides fundamental insights of murine coronavirus disinfection.

In response, onsite water reuse practices have been adopted by several cities globally. In addition to technological innovation, these novel water treatment systems also require new stakeholder collaborations, relationships, and processes to support them. There are, however, few models for stakeholder arrangements that support and encourage the adoption and success of such infrastructure. In this paper, we use interviews with stakeholders involved in onsite water reuse projects in the San Francisco Bay Area to create a social network map that describes the interactions between stakeholders at large and during specific phases of project implementation. Using qualitative content analysis of expert interviews and social network analysis, we identify four actor roles that are key to the functioning of this novel water infrastructure paradigm-specialists, continuity providers, program champions, and conveners-and discuss the importance of each role through the course of project implementation. These findings can be helpful for policy interventions and outreach efforts by other cities and communities looking to implement onsite water systems."

Here, we introduce a novel electrosorption-based boron removal technology with the capability to overcome the limitations of current state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, we incorporate a bipolar membrane (BPM) between a pair of porous carbon electrodes, demonstrating a synergized BPM-electrosorption process for the first time. The ion transport and charge transfer mechanisms of the BPM-electrosorption system are thoroughly investigated, confirming that water dissociation in the BPM is highly coupled with electrosorption of anions at the anode. We then demonstrate effective boron removal by the BPM-electrosorption system and verify that the mechanism for boron removal is electrosorption, as opposed to adsorption on the carbon electrodes or in the BPM. The effect of applied voltage on the boron removal performance is then evaluated, revealing that applied potentials above similar to 1.0 V result in a decline in process efficiency due to the increased prevalence of detrimental Faradaic reactions at the anode. The BPM-electrosorption system is then directly compared with flow-through electrosorption, highlighting key advantages of the process with regard to boron sorption capacity and energy consumption. Overall, the BPM-electrosorption shows promising boron removal capability, with a sorption capacity >4.5 mu mol g-C-1 and a corresponding specific energy consumption of <2.5 kWh g-B-1."

In theory, PD offers near-perfect rejection for nonvolatile solutes, chlorine resistance, and the ability to decouple water and solute transport. Despite its advantages, pore wetting and the development of a reverse transmembrane temperature difference are potential critical concerns in PD, with the former compromising the salt rejection and the latter reducing or even eliminating the driving force for vapor transport. We herein present an analysis to evaluate the practical viability and membrane design principles of PD with a focus on the dependence of flux and salt rejection (SR) on membrane properties. By modeling the mass transfer in a PD process under different conditions, we arrive at two important conclusions. First, a practically detrimental reverse transmembrane temperature difference does not develop in PD under all relevant circumstances and is thus not a practical concern. Second, for a PD process to achieve an acceptable SR, the membrane pores should be at the nanometer scale with a highly uniform pore size distribution. This analysis demonstrates the practical viability of PD and provides the principles for designing robust and high-performance PD membranes."

Besides known PFAAs, numerous unknown species may exist in the environment, urgently needing discovery and characterization. This study implemented nontarget analysis for a group of novel PFAA pollutants, viz., iodinated PFAAs (I-PFAAs) in wastewater from a fluorochemical manufacturing park by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry in combina-tion with an iodine-specific data-processing algorithm. The algorithm took into account the diagnostic fragment iodine ion (I-) together with carbon and sulfur isotopologue distributions. In total, 18 I-PFAA formulas involving 21 congeners were identified. Semiquantification was conducted, and the total concentrations of I-PFAAs were 1.9-274.7 mu g/L, indicating severe pollution of I-PFAAs in the wastewater. The determined concentrations along with predicted environmental behaviors and toxicities demonstrate that I-PFAAs merit further in-depth investigation. The analytical method including the instrumental analysis and data-processing algorithm can be extended to screening and identification of I-PFAAs in other matrices. Furthermore, the analysis results for the first time provide recognition on the occurrence, distribution features, and pollution status of I-PFAAs in the environment."

Highly utilization of light energy, uniformly dispersed nanoparticles, large specific surface area, improved metal reducibility, and oxygen desorption and migration ability at low temperature contribute to the good catalytic oxidation activity of AMO-250. Light activated more lattice oxygen to participate in the reaction via the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, and traditional e--h+ photocatalytic behavior exists over the AMO-250 heterostructure composite as an auxiliary degradation path.

The identification of the structures of OPEs is a prerequisite for subsequent assessment of their environmental impacts, which could hardly be accomplished using traditional target analytical methods. In this study, we describe the use of suspect and nontarget screening techniques for identification of organo-phosphate triesters and diesters (tri-OPEs and di-OPEs) in the influent and effluent samples acquired from 25 municipal WWTPs across China. There are totally 33 different OPE molecules identified, 11 of which are detected in wastewater for the first time and 4 are new to the public. In all tested samples, di-OPEs account for a significant portion (53% on average) of the total OPEs (ng/L-mu g/L). More importantly, most of the OPEs could not be eliminated after treatment in these WWTPs, while some of the di-OPEs even accumulate. The research priority of OPEs in the effluent based on ecological risk was also analyzed, and the results reflected a previously unrecognized exposure risk of emerging OPEs for aquatic living organisms. These findings present a holistic understanding of the environmental relevance of OPEs in WWTPs on a country scale, which will hopefully provide guidance for the upgrade of treatment protocols in WWTPs and even for the modification of governmental regulations in the future."

The objective of this review was to critically evaluate the existing literature that assessed the impact of potentially enhancing conditions to OPPP occurrence associated with residential plumbing and to point out knowledge gaps. Comprehensive studies on the topic were found to be lacking. Major knowledge gaps identified include the assessment of OPPP growth in the residential plumbing, from building entry to fixtures, and evaluation of the extent of the impact of typical residential plumbing design (e.g., trunk and branch and manifold), components (e.g., valves and fixtures), water heater types and temperature setting of operation, and common pipe materials (copper, PEX, and PVC/CPVC). In addition, impacts of the current plumbing code requirements on OPPP responses have not been assessed by any study and a lack of guidelines for OPPP risk management in residences was identified. Finally, the research required to expand knowledge on OPPP amplification in residences was discussed."

However, little is known regarding the mechanisms that control simultaneous co-sorption of As(V) and Sb(V) to jarosite. We investigated the mechanisms controlling As(V) and Sb(V) sorption to jarosite at pH 3 (in dual and single metalloid treatments). Jarosite was found to sorb Sb(V) to a greater extent than As(V) in both single and dual metalloid treatments. Relative to single metalloid treatments, the dual presence of both As(V) and Sb(V) decreased the sorption of both metalloids by almost 50%. Antimony K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy revealed that surface precipitation of an Sb(V) oxide species was the predominant sorption mechanism for Sb(V). In contrast, As K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy showed that As(V) sorption occurred via bidentate corner-sharing complexes on the jarosite surface when Sb(V) was absent or present at low loadings or by formation of similar complexes on the Sb(V) oxide surface precipitate when Sb(V) was present at high loadings. These results point to a novel mechanism by which Sb(V) impacts the co-sorption of As(V). Overall, these findings highlight a strong contrast in the sorption mechanisms of Sb(V) versus As(V) to jarosite under acidic environmental conditions."

However, limitations appear in the UV/ hypochlorite and UV/monochloramine for removing specific con-taminants ascribed to the differences in the sorts and yields of free radicals. Here, this study reports UV/dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) as a novel source of radicals. NaDCC was demonstrated to be a well-balanced compound between hypochlorite and monochloramine, and it had significant UV absorption and a medium intrinsic quantum yield. The UV/NaDCC produced more substantial hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) and reactive chlorine species (RCSs, including Cl center dot, ClO center dot, and Cl2 center dot-) than conventional UV/chlor(am)ine, thereby generating a higher oxidation efficiency. The reaction mechanisms, environmental applicability, and energy requirements of the UV/NaDCC process for emerging contaminants (ECs) abatement were further investigated. The results showed that center dot OH and center dot NH2 attacked ECs mostly through hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical adduct formation, whereas Cl center dot destroyed ECs mainly through HAT and single electron transfer, with ClO center dot playing a certain role through HAT. Kinetic model analyses revealed that the UV/NaDCC outperformed the conventional UV/chlor(am)ine in a variety of water matrices with superior degradation efficiency, significantly saving up to 96% electrical energy per order. Overall, this study first demonstrates application prospects of a novel AOP using UV/ NaDCC, which can compensate for the deficiency of the conventional UV/chlor(am)ine AOPs."

The present study unprecedentedly investigated both 16 tri-OPEs and 8 di-OPEs in proglacial and ocean sediments from Ny-Alesund, the Arctic. Mean concentrations of tri-OPEs and di-OPEs in proglacial sediments were 487 and 341 pg/g dry weight (dw), respectively, which were significantly lower than those in ocean sediments (1692 and 525 pg/g dw). Ocean sediments might be simultaneously influenced by long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT), oceanic transport, and human activities, whereas proglacial sediments, since they are isolated from human settlements, may be dominantly affected by LRAT. Such source difference was evidenced by the contamination profile of OPEs: chlorinated tri-OPEs with high environmental persistence and high LRAT were dominant in proglacial sediments (66%); however, weakly environmentally persistent and highly hydrophobic aryl tri-OPEs were dominant in ocean sediments (47%), which were plausibly from local emission sources due to their low LRAT potential. Di-OPEs in proglacial and ocean sediments were dominated by groups of parent tri-OPEs with strong photodegradability, such as alkyl (75%) and aryl (58%). A higher mean molar ratio of di-OPE/tri-OPE in the proglacial sediment (14) than that in the ocean sediment (2.2) may be related to its higher photodegradation than that of the ocean sediment."

Herein, a ternary composite material Al-Fe-AC is synthesized via a ballmilling treatment on a mixture of Al0, Fe0, and activated carbon and a nitrogen (N2)-selectivity of > 75%. The mechanism study reveals that, in the initial stage, numerous Al//AC and Fe//AC microgalvanic cells in the Al-Fe-AC material could lead to a local alkaline environment in the vicinity of the AC cathodes. The local alkalinity depassivated the Al0 component and enabled its continuous dissolution in the subsequent second stage of reaction. The functioning of the AC cathode of the Al//AC microgalvanic cell is revealed as the primary reason accounting for the highly selective reduction of nitrate. The investigation on the mass ratio of raw materials manifested that an Al/Fe/AC mass ratio of 1:1:5 or 1:3:5 was preferable. The test in simulated groundwater suggested that the as-prepared Al-Fe-AC powder could be injected into aquifers to achieve a highly selective reduction of nitrate to nitrogen.

The domestic well population of the western Great Basin (WGB) is at increased risk of exposure to arsenic due to the hydrologic, geologic, and climatic setting of the region. A logistic regression (LR) model was developed to predict the probability of elevated arsenic (>= 5 mu g/L) in alluvial aquifers and assess the potential geologic hazard level posed to domestic well populations. Alluvial aquifers are susceptible to arsenic contamination, which is a concern because they are the primary source of water for domestic well users of the WGB. The probability of elevated arsenic at a domestic well is strongly influenced by tectonic and geothermal variables, including the total Quaternary fault length in the hydrographic basin and the distance between the sampled well and a geothermal system. The model had an overall accuracy of 81%, sensitivity of 92%, and specificity of 55%. Results show a >50% probability of elevated arsenic in untreated well water for approximately 49 thousand (64%) alluvial-aquifer domestic well users in northern Nevada, northeastern California, and western Utah."

However, most of the investigations focused on monocultures or a single organism, with little information available on the complex syntrophic consortium that dominates the complex and successional biochemical processes, such as anaerobic digestion. In this study, the effect of BmimCl at environmentally relevant levels on glucose anaerobic digestion was therefore investigated in several laboratory-scale mesophilic anaerobic digesters to provide such support. Experimental results showed that BmimCl at 1-20 mg/L inhibited the methane production rate by 3.50-31.03%, and 20 mg/L BmimCl inhibited butyrate, hydrogen, and acetate biotransformation by 14.29%, 36.36%, and 11.57%, respectively. Toxicological mechanism studies revealed that extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) adsorbed and accumulated BmimCl through carboxyl, amino, and hydroxyl groups, which destroyed the EPSs' conformational structure, thereby leading to the inactivation of microbial cells. MiSeq sequencing data indicated that the abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Bacteroides, and Methanothrix decreased by 6.01%, 7.02%, and 18.45%, respectively, in response to 20 mg/L BmimCl. Molecular ecological network analysis showed that compared with the control, the lower network complexity, fewer keystone taxa, and fewer associations among microbial taxa were found in the BmimCl-present digester, indicating the reduced stability of the microbial community."

Many studies have analyzed LCMs in multiple environmental matrices, yet limited research has investigated the toxic effects upon exposure to them. In this study, we combined in silico simulation and in vitro assay validation along with omics integration analysis to achieve a comprehensive toxicity elucidation as well as a systematic mechanism interpretation of LCMs for the first time. Briefly, the high-throughput virtual screen and reporter gene assay revealed that peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) was significantly antagonized by certain LCMs. Besides, LCMs induced global metabolome and transcriptome dysregulation in HK2 cells. Notably, fatty acid beta-oxidation was conspicuously dysregulated, which might be mediated through multiple pathways (IL-17, TNF, and NF-kB), whereas the activation of AMPK and ligand-dependent PPAR gamma antagonism may play particularly important parts. This study illustrated LCMs as a potential PPAR gamma antagonist and explored their toxicological mode of action on the trans-omics level, which provided an insightful overview in future chemical risk assessment."

This is mainly due to constraints in data availability and compatibility with LCA inventories. To target this gap, relative pollinator abundance estimates were obtained with the use of a Delphi assessment, during which 25 experts, covering 16 nationalities and 45 countries of expertise, provided scores for low, typical, and high expected abundance associated with 24 land use categories. Based on these estimates, this study presents a set of globally generic characterization factors (CFs) that allows translating land use into relative impacts to wild pollinator abundance. The associated uncertainty of the CFs is presented along with an illustrative case to demonstrate the applicability in LCA studies. The CFs based on estimates that reached consensus during the Delphi assessment are recommended as readily applicable and allow key differences among land use types to be distinguished. The resulting CFs are proposed as the first step for incorporating pollinator impacts in LCA studies, exemplifying the use of expert elicitation methods as a useful tool to fill data gaps that constrain the characterization of key environmental impacts."

Alternatively, the use of a renewable lignocellulose-derived carbon source, cellulosic hydrolysate, offers a cost-effective and sustainable pathway to cultivate microalgae heterotrophically with high algal growth rate and terminal density. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of cellulosic hydrolysate-mediated hetero-trophic cultivation (Cel-HC) for microalgae production by performing economic and environmental comparisons with photo-trophic cultivation through techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment. We estimate a minimum selling price (MSP) of 4722 USD/t for producing high-purity microalgae through Cel-HC considering annual biomass productivity of 300 t (dry weight), which is competitive with the conventional phototrophic raceway pond system. Revenues from the lignocellulose-derived co-products, xylose and fulvic acid fertilizer, could further reduce the MSP 2976 USD/t, highlighting the advantages of simultaneously producing high-value products and biofuels in an integrated biorefinery scheme. Further, Cel-HC exhibits lower environmental impacts, such as cumulative energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, than phototrophic systems, revealing its potential to reduce the carbon intensity of algae-derived commodities. Our results demonstrate the economic and environmental competitiveness of heterotrophic microalgae production based on renewable bio-feedstock of lignocellulose."

The emergence of ever-increasing varieties of environmental pollutants makes it difficult to perform timely assessments, especially using in vivo models. Herein, we propose a deep learning-based morphometric analysis (DLMA) to quantitatively identify eight abnormal phenotypes (head hemorrhage, jaw malformation, uninflated swim bladder, pericardial edema, yolk edema, bent spine, dead, unhatched) and eight vital organ features (eye, head, jaw, heart, yolk, swim bladder, body length, and curvature) of zebrafish larvae. A data set composed of 2532 bright-field micrographs of zebrafish larvae at 120 h post fertilization was generated from toxicity screening of three categories of chemicals, i.e., endocrine disruptors (perfluorooctanesulfonate and bisphenol A), heavy metals (CdCl2 and PbI2), and emerging organic pollutants (acetaminophen, 2,7-dibromocarbazole, 3-monobromocarbazo, 3,6-dibromocarbazole, and 1,3,6,8-tetrabromocarbazo). Two typical deep learning models, one-stage and two-stage models (TensorMask, Mask R-CNN), were trained to implement phenotypic feature classification and segmentation. The accuracy was statistically validated with a mean average precision >0.93 in unlabeled data sets and a mean accuracy >0.86 in previously published data sets. Such a method effectively enables subjective morphometric analysis of zebrafish larvae to achieve efficient hazard identification of both chemicals and environmental pollutants."

However, how the exposure order to sunlight and DOM modifies the environmental behavior of nanoplastics is seldomly determined. Here, with two different exposure orders, we investigated the impact of molecular-weight (MW)-fractionated humic acids (HAs) derived from biochar and the Suwannee River, respectively, on the aggregation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) nanoplastics (PET-NPs) in mono- and divalent electrolyte solutions. For exposure pattern (i) (photoaging followed by HA coating), photoaged PET-NPs had more oxidized surfaces and exhibited 22-320% higher binding affinity to HAs (especially the higher MW fractions) than the pristine counterparts, which greatly improved the dispersion of PET-NPs. For exposure pattern (ii) (HA coating followed by photoaging), HA-PET assemblies were formed, the dispersion of which increased with increasing irradiation time and was significantly higher than that of the samples in the exposure pattern (i) at the end of the experiment. This high dispersion of photoaged HA-PET assemblies was ascribed to the extra oxidation of PET by reactive oxygen species generated in the PET-HA interfaces during photoaging. These findings highlight the active nature of HA-PET assemblies, which provide new insight into the reaction of HA with nanoplastics beyond adsorption in the natural environment."

Although they have been frequently detected in aquatic environments around the globe, little is known regarding their adverse effects on humans and aquatic organisms. Recently, an in vitro monoamine transporter inhibition assay was developed to detect transporter-inhibitory activities of antidepressants in wastewater in Japan. However, it was unclear which antidepressants were responsible for transporter-inhibitory activities in wastewater. Herein, the per capita consumption of 32 antidepressants, their excretion of unchanged parent compounds, per capita water consumption, removal rate during wastewater treatment processes, and potency values from the monoamine transporter inhibition assay were used to prioritize antidepressants of concern in effluent wastewater in England and Japan. In both countries, sertraline and O-desmethylvenlafaxine had the highest contribution to inhibitory activities against the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) and zebrafish SERT (zSERT), respectively. It was found that the antidepressants inhibited the zSERT more strongly than the hSERT. The inhibitory activities found against the zSERT in wastewater in England and Japan were higher than thresholds for abnormal behavior in fish. The antidepressants prioritized in this study provide insight into launching environmental monitoring and ecotoxicological studies of antidepressants."

However, a substantial number of food additives (e.g., salt, allicin, capsaicin, allyl isothiocyanate, monosodium glutamate, and nonnutritive sweeteners) are present in food waste, and their interactions with anaerobic digestion might affect energy recovery, which is typically overlooked. This work describes the current understanding of the occurrence and fate of food additives in anaerobic digestion of food waste. The biotransformation pathways of food additives during anaerobic digestion are well discussed. In addition, important discoveries in the effects and underlying mechanisms of food additives on anaerobic digestion are reviewed. The results showed that most of the food additives had negative effects on anaerobic digestion by deactivating functional enzymes, thus inhibiting methane production. By reviewing the response of microbial communities to food additives, we can further improve our understanding of the impact of food additives on anaerobic digestion. Intriguingly, the possibility that food additives may promote the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, and thus threaten ecology and public health, is highlighted. Furthermore, strategies for mitigating the effects of food additives on anaerobic digestion are outlined in terms of optimal operation conditions, effectiveness, and reaction mechanisms, among which chemical methods have been widely used and are effective in promoting the degradation of food additives and increasing methane production. This review aims to advance our understanding of the fate and impact of food additives in anaerobic digestion and to spark novel research ideas for optimizing anaerobic digestion of organic solid waste."

In this study, a bubbleless aerated BAC (termed ABAC) process was developed by installing a hollow fiber membrane (HFM) module within a BAC filter to continuously provide aeration throughout the BAC system. The BAC filter without an HFM was termed NBAC. The laboratory-scale ABAC and NBAC systems operated continuously for 426 days using secondary sewage effluent as an influent. The DO concentrations for NBAC and ABAC were 0.78 +/- 0.27 and 4.31 +/- 0.44 mg/L, respectively, with the latter providing the ABAC with greater electron acceptors for biodegradation and a microbial community with better biodegradation and metabolism capacity. The biofilms in ABAC secreted 47.3% less EPS and exhibited greater electron transfer capacity than those in NBAC, resulting in enhanced contaminant degradation efficiency and long-term stability. The extra organic matter removed by ABAC included refractory substances with a low elemental ratio of oxygen to carbon (O/C) and a high elemental ratio of hydrogen to carbon (H/C). The proposed ABAC filter provides a valuable, practical example of how to modify the BAC technology to shape the microbial community, and its activity, by optimizing the ambient atmosphere.

Here, we show, by combining ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, that the DOM molecular composition varies considerably among 43 lakes in East Antarctica that are isolated from terrestrial inputs and human influence. The DOM composition in these lakes is primarily driven by differences in the degree of photodegradation, sulfurization, and pH. Remarkable molecular beta-diversity of DOM was found that rivals the dissimilarity between DOM of rivers and the deep ocean, which was driven by environmental dissimilarity rather than the spatial distance. Our results emphasize that the extensive molecular diversity of DOM can arise even in one of the most pristine and organic matter source-limited environments on Earth, but at the same time the DOM composition is predictable by environmental variables and the lakes' ecological history."

However, owing to their great growth rate and large nutrient intake capacity, algae can enrich a large amount of carbon (CO2) and nutritional elements (N and P) in their biomass. Thus, this could be applied as a robust approach to battle global warming and water eutrophication if the harmful algae biomass was effectively harvested and utilized. Herein, we propose a thermochemical approach to convert algae biomass into a nitrogen-doped electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. The as synthesized carbon catalyst exhibits a favorable electrochemical CO2 reduction activity. The key drivers of the environmental impacts in the thermochemical conversion approach with a comparison with the commonly used landfilling approach are identified with life cycle assessment. The former presents much lower environmental burdens in terms of impacts such as freshwater/terrestrial ecotoxicity and human toxicity than the latter. Moreover, if the thermochemical conversion process was successfully applied for biomass conversion worldwide, 2.17 x 108 tons of CO2-eq, 8.42 x 106 tons of N, and 1.21 x 106 tons of P could be removed from the global carbon and other element cycles. Meanwhile, the thermochemical approach is also similar to landfilling in terms of costs. The results from this work provide a brandnew perspective for achieving twofold CO2 utilization and efficiently battling harmful algae blooms.

This is achieved by developing a novel use of an iron salt (i.e., FeCl3) in an integrated anaerobic wastewater treatment and mainstream anammox process. FeCl3 was chosen to be dosed in a proposed sidestream unit rather than in a primary settler or a mainstream reactor. This causes acidification of returned activated sludge and enables stable suppression of nitrite-oxidizing bacterial activity and excess sludge reduction. A laboratory-scale system, which comprised an anaerobic baffled reactor, a continuous-flow anoxic-aerobic (A/O) reactor, and a secondary settler, was designed to treat real domestic wastewater, with the performance of the system comprehensively monitored under a steady-state condition. The experimental assessments showed that the system had good effluent quality, with total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of 12.6 +/- 1.3 mg N/L and 0.34 +/- 0.05 mg P/L, respectively. It efficiently retained phosphorus in excess sludge (0.18 +/- 0.03 g P/g dry sludge), suggesting its potential for further recovery. About half of influent organic carbon was recovered in the form of bioenergy (i.e., methane). This together with low energy consumption revealed that the system could produce a net energy of about 0.11 kWh/m3-wastewater, assessed by an energy balance analysis."

The pollution of sulfonamide antibiotics in aqueous system has attracted increasing public attention. Hydroxylation of the central amine group can trigger a series of metabolic processes of sulfonamide antibiotics in humans; however, this work parallelly reported the coupling and fragmenting initiated by amino H-abstraction of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) catalyzed by human CYP450 enzymes. Elucidation of the emerging metabolic profiles was mapped via a multistep synergy between computations and experiments, involving preliminary DFT computations and in vitro and in vivo assays, profiling adverse effects, and rationalizing the fundamental factors via targeted computations. Especially, the confirmed SMX dimer was shown to potentially act as a metabolism disruptor in humans, while spin aromatic delocalization resulting in the low electron donor ability of amino radicals was revealed as the fundamental factor to enable coupling of sulfonamide antibiotics by CYP450 through the nonconventional nonrebound pathway. This work may further strengthen the synergistic use of computations prior to experiments to avoid wasteful experimental screening efforts in environmental chemistry and toxicology."

More recently, they have been recognized as important aquatic micropollutants. Despite that, only a few PTs have been detected and reported in terrestrial and aquatic environments, while their source and leaching pathways remain largely unclear. Herein, we established a novel approach named source-supported suspect screening (4S) to discover PTs in different environments, investigate their environmental occurrences, identify their sources, and initiate discussions on their leaching mechanisms. The 4S-approach was demonstrated on a five-month Lupinus angustifolius L. (L. angustifolius) crop field experiment, where plant, topsoil, drainage water, and surface water were sampled and analyzed. As a result, 72 PTs (flavonoids and alkaloids) were identified at high confidence, with 10 PTs fully confirmed. Fifty-three PTs detected in soil or water were linked to L. angustifolius, among which 26 PTs were coherently detected in all three environmental compartments. The occurrence and abundance of PTs in terrestrial soil and aquatic environments were influenced by the plant growth stage and precipitation. Soil served as an intermedium when PTs leached from L. angustifolius to the drainage water, while the degree of retardation and eventual occurrence in the aquatic environment depended on both PTs and soil physico-chemical properties."

More recently, they have been recognized as important aquatic micropollutants. Despite that, only a few PTs have been detected and reported in terrestrial and aquatic environments, while their source and leaching pathways remain largely unclear. Herein, we established a novel approach named source-supported suspect screening (4S) to discover PTs in different environments, investigate their environmental occurrences, identify their sources, and initiate discussions on their leaching mechanisms. The 4S-approach was demonstrated on a five-month Lupinus angustifolius L. (L. angustifolius) crop field experiment, where plant, topsoil, drainage water, and surface water were sampled and analyzed. As a result, 72 PTs (flavonoids and alkaloids) were identified at high confidence, with 10 PTs fully confirmed. Fifty-three PTs detected in soil or water were linked to L. angustifolius, among which 26 PTs were coherently detected in all three environmental compartments. The occurrence and abundance of PTs in terrestrial soil and aquatic environments were influenced by the plant growth stage and precipitation. Soil served as an intermedium when PTs leached from L. angustifolius to the drainage water, while the degree of retardation and eventual occurrence in the aquatic environment depended on both PTs and soil physico-chemical properties."

Experimentally evaluating the (eco)toxicity of MNMs is time-consuming and expensive due to the multiple environmental factors, the complexity of material properties, and the species diversity. Machine learning (ML) models provide an option to deal with heterogeneous data sets and complex relationships. The present study established an in silico model based on a machine learning properties-environmental conditions-multi species-toxicity predic-tion model (ML-PEMST) that can be applied to predict the toxicity of different MNMs toward multiple aquatic species. Feature importance and interaction analysis based on the random forest method indicated that exposure duration, illumination, primary size, and hydrodynamic diameter were the main factors affecting the ecotoxicity of MNMs to a variety of aquatic organisms. Illumination was demonstrated to have the most interaction with the other features. Moreover, incorporating additional detailed information on the ecological traits of the test species will allow us to further optimize and improve the predictive performance of the model. This study provides a new approach for ecotoxicity predictions for organisms in the aquatic environment and will help us to further explore exposure pathways and the risk assessment of MNMs."	"[Zhou, Yunchi; Wang, Ying; Fan, Wenhong] Beihang Univ, Sch Space & Environm, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Peijnenburg, Willie; Vijver, Martina G.; Balraadjsing, Surendra] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Peijnenburg, Willie] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, Ctr Safety Subst & Prod, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Fan, Wenhong] Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Big Data Based Precis Med, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China"	"Beihang University; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment; Beihang University"	"Wang, Y; Fan, WH (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Space & Environm, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.;Fan, WH (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Big Data Based Precis Med, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China."

To date, the photo degradation capacity of TWPs on contaminants due to biofilm formation has not been quantified. To accomplish this, we examined the ability of virgin TWPs (V-TWPs) and biofilm-developed TWPs (Bio-TWPs) to photo degrade TC when exposed to simulated sunlight irradiation. V-TWPs and Bio-TWPs accelerated the photodegradation of TC, with rates (kobs) of 0.0232 +/- 0.0014 and 0.0152 +/- 0.0010 h-1, respectively (kobs increased by 2.5-3.7 times compared to that for only TC solution). An important factor of increased TC photodegradation behavior was identified and linked to the changed reactive oxygen species (ROS) of different TWPs. The V-TWPs were exposed to light for 48 h, resulting in more ROS for attacking TC, with hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) and superoxide anions (O2 center dot-) playing a dominant role in TC photodegradation measured using scavenger/probe chemicals. This was primarily due to the greater photosensitization effects and higher electron transfer capacity of V-TWPs in comparison to Bio-TWPs. In addition, this study first sheds light on the unique effect and intrinsic mechanism of the crucial role of Bio-TWPs in TC photodegradation, enhancing our holistic understanding of the environmental behavior of TWPs and the associated contaminants."

Reef monitoring is routinely used to help prioritize reefs for conservation and evaluate the success of intervention efforts. Reef status and health are most frequently characterized using diver-based surveys, but the inherent limitations of these methods mean there is a growing need for advanced, standardized, and automated reef techniques that capture the complex nature of the ecosystem. Here we draw on experiences from our own interdisciplinary research programs to describe advances in in situ diver-based and autonomous reef monitoring. We present our vision for integrating interdisciplinary measurements for select case-study reefs worldwide and for learning patterns within the biological, physical, and chemical reef components and their interactions. Ultimately, these efforts could support the development of a scalable and standardized suite of sensors that capture and relay key data to assist in categorizing reef health. This framework has the potential to provide stakeholders with the information necessary to assess reef health during an unprecedented time of reef change as well as restoration and intervention activities."

The net benefits of using purifiers in cities varied across scenarios. Cities with a lower ratio of annual average outdoor PM2.5 concentration to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita tended to achieve higher net benefits in the scenario with a lower indoor PM2.5 target. Controlling ambient PM2.5 pollution and developing the economy can reduce the inequality in air purifier use across China."

Reef monitoring is routinely used to help prioritize reefs for conservation and evaluate the success of intervention efforts. Reef status and health are most frequently characterized using diver-based surveys, but the inherent limitations of these methods mean there is a growing need for advanced, standardized, and automated reef techniques that capture the complex nature of the ecosystem. Here we draw on experiences from our own interdisciplinary research programs to describe advances in in situ diver-based and autonomous reef monitoring. We present our vision for integrating interdisciplinary measurements for select case-study reefs worldwide and for learning patterns within the biological, physical, and chemical reef components and their interactions. Ultimately, these efforts could support the development of a scalable and standardized suite of sensors that capture and relay key data to assist in categorizing reef health. This framework has the potential to provide stakeholders with the information necessary to assess reef health during an unprecedented time of reef change as well as restoration and intervention activities."

Antimicrobials are always co-occurring with anthropogenic reactive nitrogen sources. However, their impacts on the ecological safety of microbial nitrogen cycle remain poorly understood. Here, a denitrifying bacterial strain Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222 was exposed to a widespread broad-spectrum antimicrobial triclocarban (TCC) at environmental concentrations. The denitrification was hindered by TCC at 25 mu g L-1 and was completely inhibited once the TCC concentration exceeded 50 mu g L-1. Importantly, the accumulation of N2O at 25 mu g L-1 of TCC was 813 times as much as the control group without TCC, which attributed to the significantly downregulated expression of nitrous oxide reductase and the genes related to electron transfer, iron, and sulfur metabolism under TCC stress. Interestingly, combining TCC-degrading denitrifying Ochrobactrum sp. TCC-2 with strain PD1222 promoted the denitrification process and mitigated N2O emission by 2 orders of magnitude. We further consolidated the importance of complementary detoxification by introducing a TCC-hydrolyzing amidase gene tccA from strain TCC-2 into strain PD1222, which successfully protected strain PD1222 against the TCC stress. This study highlights an important link between TCC detoxification and sustainable denitrification and suggests a necessity to assess the ecological risks of antimicrobials in the context of climate change and ecosystem safety."

Biogenic sulfur (bio-S-0) has been demonstrated to have superior bioavailability, while little is known about its mechanisms thus far. This study investigated the bioavailability and relevant properties of bio-S-0 based on the denitrifying activity of Thiobacillus denitrificans with chemical sulfur (chem-S-0) as the control. It was found that the conversion rate and removal efficiency of nitrate in the bio-S-0 system were 2.23 and 2.04 times those of the chem-S-0 system. Bio-S-0 was not pure orthorhombic sulfur [S: 96.88 +/- 0.25% (w/w)]. Trace organic substances detected on the bio-S-0 surface were revealed to contribute to its hydrophilicity, resulting in better dispersibility in the aqueous liquid. In addition, the adhesion force of T. denitrificans on bio-S-0 was 1.54 times that of chem-S-0, endowing a higher bacterial adhesion efficiency on the sulfur particle. The weaker intermolecular binding force due to the low crystallinity of bio-S-0 led to enhanced cellular uptake by attached bacteria. The mechanisms for the superior bioavailability of bio-S-0 were further proposed. This study provides a comprehensive view of the superior bioavailability of bio-S-0 and is beneficial to developing high-quality sulfur resources."

To utilize such waste materials for engineered carbon mineralization purposes, there is a need to investigate the fate and mobility of toxic metals. This is a study of the coprecipitation of metals with calcium carbonate for environmental heavy metal mitigation. The study also examines the stability of precipitated phases under environmentally relevant acid conditions. For a wide range of cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) concentrations (10 to 5000 mg/L), induced coprecipitation led to greater than 99% uptake from water. The calcium carbonate phases were found to contain amounts as high as 9.9 wt % (Cd) and 17 wt % (Zn), as determined by novel synchrotron techniques, including X-ray fluorescence element mapping and three-dimensional (3D) nanotransmission X-ray microscopy (TXM). TXM imaging revealed first-of-a-kind observations of chemical gradients and internal nanoporosity within particles. These observations provided new insights into the mechanisms leading to the retention of coprecipitated heavy metals during the dissolution of calcite in acidic (pH 4) solutions. These observations highlight the feasibility of utilizing carbonate coprecipitation as an engineered approach to the durable sequestration of toxic metals."

Iron (Fe) (hydr)oxides greatly control the cycling and fate and thus isotope fractionation factors of Zn in terrestrial environments. Here, Zn isotope fractionation and related mechanisms during adsorption on and substitution in three FeOOH polymorphs are explored. Results demonstrate that heavy Zn isotopes are preferentially enriched onto solids, with almost similar isotopic offsets (Delta 66/64Znsolid-solution= 0.25-0.36 parts per thousand) for goethite, lepidocrocite, and feroxyhyte. This is consistent with the same average Zn-O bond lengths for adsorbed Zn on these solids as revealed by Zn K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. In contrast, at an initial Zn/Fe molar ratio of 0.02, incorporation of Zn into goethite and lepidocrocite by substituting for lattice Fe preferentially sequesters light Zn isotopes with Delta 66/64Znsubstituted-stock solution of -1.52 +/- 0.09 parts per thousand and -1.18 +/- 0.15 parts per thousand, while Zn-substituted feroxyhyte (0.06 +/- 0.11 parts per thousand) indicates almost no isotope fractionation. This is closely related to the different crystal nucleation and growth rates during the Zn-doped FeOOH formation processes. These results provide direct experimental evidence of incorporation of isotopically light Zn into Fe (hydr)oxides and improve our understanding of Zn isotope fractionation mechanisms during mineral-solution interface processes."

Vehicle emissions and heterogeneous reactions have been identified as major sources of urban HONO. Here, we report on HONO emissions from residential natural gas (RNG) for water and space heating in urban areas based on in situ measurements. The observed HONO emission factors (EFs) of RNG heating vary between 6.03 and 608 mg center dot m-3 NG, which are highly dependent on the thermal load. The highest HONO EFs are observed at a high thermal load via the thermal NO homogeneous reaction. The average HONO EFs of RNG water heating in winter are 1.8 times higher than that in summer due to the increased thermal load caused by the lower inlet water temperatures in winter. The power-based HONO EFs of the traditional RNG heaters are 1085 times and 1.7 times higher than those of gasoline and diesel vehicles that meet the latest emission standards, respectively. It is estimated that the HONO emissions from RNG heaters in a typical Chinese city are gradually close to emissions from on-road vehicles when temperatures decline. These findings highlight that RNG heating is a non-negligible source of urban HONO emissions in China. With the continuous acceleration of coal-to-gas projects and the continuous tightening of NOx emission standards for vehicle exhaust, HONO emissions from RNG heaters will become more prominent in urban areas. Hence, it is urgently needed to upgrade traditional RNG heaters with efficient emission reduction technologies such as frequency-converted blowers, secondary condensers, and low-NOx combustors."

To date, their concentrations in environmental samples have not been reported due to the lack of sensitive methods. Herein, a novel chemical derivatization was developed for quantitative analysis of trace PFOSF and PFHxSF in soil by derivatizing them to the corresponding perfluoroalkane sulfinic acids. The method showed good linearity in the range from 25 to 500 ng L-1 with correlation coefficients (R2) better than 0.99. The detection limit of PFOSF in soil was 0.066 ng g-1 with recoveries in the range of 96-111%. Meanwhile, the detection limit of PFHxSF was 0.072 ng g-1 with recoveries in the range of 72-89%. Simultaneously, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) were also detected accurately without being affected by the derivative reaction. By applying this method in an abandoned fluorochemical manufacturing facility, PFOSF and PFHxSF were successfully detected at concentrations ranging from 2.7 to 357 ng g-1 and 0.23 to 26 ng g-1 dry weight, respectively. It is very interesting that 2 years after factory relocation, there still exists high concentrations of PFOSF and PFHxSF, which is of concern."

The UVALED/PI AOP remarkably enhanced the degradation of NPX and seven other selected micropollutants with the observed pseudo-first-order rate constants ranging from 0.069 +/- 0.001 to 4.50 +/- 0.145 min-1 at pH 7.0, demonstrating a broad-spectrum micropollutant degradation ability. Lines of evidence from experimental analysis and kinetic modeling confirmed that hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and ozone (O3) were the dominant species generated in UVA-LED/PI AOP, and they contributed evenly to NPX degradation. Increasing the pH and irradiation wavelength negatively affected NPX degradation, and this could be well explained by the decreased quantum yield (Phi PI) of PI. The degradation kinetics of NPX by the UVA-LED/PI AOP in the presence of water matrices (i.e., chloride, bicarbonate, and humic acid) and in real waters were examined, and the underlying mechanisms were illustrated. A total of nine transformation products were identified from NPX oxidation by the UVA-LED/PI AOP, mainly via hydroxylation, dealkylation, and oxidation pathways. The UVA-LED/PI AOP proposed might be a promising technology for the treatment of micropollutants in aqueous solutions. The pivotal role of Phi PI during light photolysis of PI may guide the future design of light-assisted PI AOPs."

Combining a newly developed fluorescence trapper of reactive oxygen species with steady-state concentration calculations, we showed that raising pyrolysis temperatures of biochar (BC) from 400 to 800 degrees C remarkably enhanced trichlorophenol degradation but inhibited the catalytic production of radicals (SO4 center dot- and center dot OH) in water and soil, thereby switching a radical-based activation into an electron-transfer-dominated nonradical pathway (contribution increased from 12.9 to 76.9%). Distinct from previously reported PDS* complex-determined oxidation, in situ Raman and electrochemical results of this study demonstrated that the simultaneous activation of phenols and PDS on the biochar surface triggers the potential difference-driven electron transfer. The formed phenoxy radicals subsequently undergo coupling and polymerization reactions to generate dimeric and oligomeric intermediates, which are eventually accumulated on the biochar surface and removed. Such a unique nonmineralizing oxidation achieved an ultrahigh electron utilization efficiency (ephenols/ePDS) of 182%. Through biochar molecular modeling and theoretical calculations, we highlighted the critical role of graphitic domains rather than redox-active moieties in lowering band-gap energy to facilitate electron transfer. Our work provides insights into outstanding contradictions and controversies related to nonradical oxidation and inspiration for more oxidant-saving remediation technologies."

Over the past decades, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to designing electrocatalysts and microbes, as well as hybrid systems to push this approach toward industrial adoption. This paper summarizes these advances in order to facilitate a better understanding of electricity-driven microbial metabolism as a sustainable waste-to-resource solution. Quantitative comparisons of microbial electrosynthesis and abiotic electrosynthesis are made, and the strategy of electrocatalyst-assisted microbial electrosynthesis is critically discussed. Nitrogen recovery processes including microbial electrochemical N2 fixation, electrocatalytic N2 reduction, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), and abiotic electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia (Abio-NRA) are systematically reviewed. Furthermore, the synchronous metabolism of carbon and nitrogen using hybrid inorganic-biological systems is discussed, including advanced physicochemical, microbial, and electrochemical characterizations involved in this field. Finally, perspectives for future trends are presented. The paper provides valuable insights on the potential contribution of electricity-driven microbial valorization of waste carbon and nitrogen toward a green and sustainable society."

While today's efforts are focused on stability and scalability of LHPs, the toxicity of lead (Pb) remains a major challenge to their large-scale commercialization. Here, we present a screening-level, EPA-compliant model of fate and transport of Pb leachate in groundwater, soil, and air, following hypothetical catastrophic breakage of LHP PV modules in conceptual utility-scale sites. We estimated exposure point concentrations of Pb in each medium and found that most of the Pb is sequestered in soil. Exposure point concentrations of Pb from the perovskite film fell well below EPA maximum permissible limits in groundwater and air even upon catastrophic release from PV modules at large scales. Background Pb levels in soil can influence soil regulatory compliance, but the highest observed concentrations of perovskite-derived Pb would not exceed EPA limits under our assumptions. Nonetheless, regulatory limits are not definitive thresholds of safety, and the potential for increased bioavailability of perovskite-derived Pb may warrant additional toxicity assessment to further characterize public health risks."

Existing regulatory systems have proven to be inadequate for assessing and managing the tens of thousands of chemicals in commerce. A different approach is urgently needed to minimize ongoing production, use, and exposures to hazardous chemicals. The premise of the essential-use approach is that chemicals of concern should be used only in cases in which their function in specific products is necessary for health, safety, or the functioning of society and when feasible alternatives are unavailable. To optimize the essential-use approach for broader implementation in the United States and Canada, we recommend that governments and businesses (1) identify chemicals of concern for essentiality assessments based on a broad range of hazard traits, going beyond toxicity; (2) expedite decision-making by avoiding unnecessary assessments and strategically asking up to three questions to determine whether the use of the chemical in the product is essential; (3) apply the essential-use approach as early as possible in the process of developing and assessing chemicals; and (4) engage diverse experts in identifying chemical uses and functions, assessing alternatives, and making essentiality determinations and share such information broadly. If optimized and expanded into regulatory systems in the United States and Canada, other policymaking bodies, and businesses, the essential-use approach can improve chemicals management and shift the market toward safer chemistries that benefit human and ecological health."

Blockchain platforms consume vast amounts of electricity based on the current consensus mechanism of Proof-of-Work (PoW). Here, we point out a different consensus mechanism named Proof-of-Stake (PoS) that can eliminate the extensive energy consumption of the current PoW-based blockchain. We comprehensively elucidate the current and projected energy consumption and carbon footprint of the PoW-and PoS-based Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain platforms. The model of energy consumption of PoS-based Ethereum blockchain can lead the way toward the prediction of other PoS-based blockchain technologies in the future. With the widespread adoption of blockchain technology, if the current PoW mechanism continues to be employed, the carbon footprint of Bitcoin and Ethereum will push the global temperature above 1.5 degrees C in this century. However, a PoS-based blockchain can reduce the carbon footprint by 99% compared to the PoW mechanism. The small amount of carbon footprint from PoS-based blockchain could make blockchain an attractive technology in a carbon-constrained future. The study sheds light on the urgency of developing the PoS mechanism to solve the current sustainability problem of blockchain."

Here, we synthesized a novel blue fluorescence nanozyme CeO2@TPE with high peroxidase-like activity by employing aggregation-induced emission (AIE) tetraphenylethene (TPE) to embed into hollow CeO2 nanospheres. In the presence of ethanol oxidase (AOX) and o-phenylenediamine (OPD), we engineered an enzymatic cascade activation ratiometric fluorescence-colorimetric dual-mode system AOX/CeO2@TPE + OPD toward CH3SH. In this design, CH3SH initiated AOX catalytic activity to convert it into H2O2 for activating the peroxidase-like activity of CeO2@TPE, producing center dot OH for oxidizing the naked-eye colorless OPD into deep yellow 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP) with an absorption enhancement at similar to 425 nm, companied by a new emission peak at similar to 550 nm to match with the intrinsic emission at similar to 441 nm for observing ratiometric fluorescence response, enabling a ratiometric fluorescence-colorimetric dual-mode analysis. Interestingly, both the ratiometric fluorescence and colorimetric signals could be gathered for being converted into the hue parameter on a smartphone-based sensor, achieving the onsite visual fluorescence-colorimetric dual-mode detection of CH3SH in real environmental media with acceptable results.

With strict control measures for air pollutants during the last decade, the OA concentration in China declined slowly, while its sources remain unclear. In this study, we simulate the primary OA (POA) and secondary OA (SOA) concentrations from 2005 to 2019 with a state-of-the-art air quality model, Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ, version 5.3.2) coupled with a Two-Dimensional Volatility Basis Set (2D-VBS) module, and a long-term emission inventory of full-volatility organic compounds in China and conduct source apportionment and sensitivity analysis. The simulation results show that, from 2005 to 2019, the OA concentration in China decreased from 24.0 to 12.8 mu g/m3 with most of the reduction from POA. The OA pollution from residential biomass burning declined 75% from 2005 to 2019, while it is still the major OA source in China. OA pollution from VCP increased by more than 2-fold and became the largest SOA source in China. From 2014 to 2019, the NOx control in China slightly offset the decrease of SOA concentration due to elevated oxidation capacity."

While frameworks to assess the environmental impacts of freshwater consumption have been proposed at the regional scale, an operational method to evaluate the consequences of consumption on different compartments of the water system and account for their interdependence is missing at the global scale. Here, we develop depletion factors that simultaneously quantify the effects of water consumption on streamflow, groundwater storage, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration globally. We estimate freshwater availability and water consumption using the output of a global-scale surface water-groundwater model for the period 1960-2000. The resulting depletion factors are provided for 8,664 river basins, representing 93% of the landmass with significant water consumption, i.e., excluding Greenland, Antarctica, deserts, and permanently frozen areas. Our findings show that water consumption leads to the largest water loss in rivers, followed by aquifers and soil, while simultaneously increasing evapotranspiration. Depletion factors vary regionally with ranges of up to four orders of magnitude depending on the annual consumption level, the type of water used, aridity, and water transfers between compartments. Our depletion factors provide valuable insights into the intertwined effects of surface and groundwater consumption on several hydrological variables over a specified period. The developed depletion factors can be integrated into sustainability assessment tools to quantify the ecological impacts of water consumption and help guide sustainable water management strategies, while accounting for the performance limitations of the underlying model."

Dissolved organic matter including humic-like substances (HS), acting as photosensitizers that participate in electron transfer reactions, can generate a variety of reactive species, such as OH radicals and excited triplet-state HS (3HS*), which promote the degradation of organic compounds. We use phthalate esters, which are important contaminants found in wastewaters, landfills, soils, rivers, lakes, groundwaters, and mine tailings. We use phthalate esters as probes to study the reactivity of HS irradiated with artificial sunlight. Phthalate esters with different side-chain lengths were used as probes for elucidation of reaction mechanisms using 2H and 13C isotope fractionation. Reference experiments with the artificial photosensitizers 4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2 ',4 ',5 ',7 '-tetraiodofluorescein (Rose Bengal), 3-methoxy-acetophenone (3-MAP), and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (4-MBA) yielded characteristic fractionation factors (-4 +/- 1, -4 +/- 2, and -4 +/- 1%o for 2H; 0.7 +/- 0.2, 1.0 +/- 0.4, and 0.8 +/- 0.2%o for 13C), allowing interpretation of reaction mechanisms of humic substances with phthalate esters. The correlation of 2H and 13C fractions can be used diagnostically to determine photosensitized reactions in the environment and to differentiate among biodegradation, hydrolysis, and photosensitized HS reaction."

Many studies have revealed that TiO2 promotes the heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 and the subsequent sulfate formation. However, whether and how much TiO2 contributes to the gaseous H2SO4 and subsequent new particle formation (NPF) still remains unclear. Herein, we used a 1 m3 quartz smog chamber to investigate NPF in the presence of TiO2. The experimental results indicated that TiO2 could greatly promote NPF. The increases in particle formation rate (J) and growth rate due to the presence of TiO2 were quantified, and the promotion effect was attributed to the production of gaseous H2SO4. The promotion effect of TiO2 on SO2 oxidation and subsequent NPF decreased gradually due to the formation of surface sulfate but did not disappear completely, instead partly recovering after washing with water. Moreover, the promotion effect of TiO2 on NPF was observed regardless of differences in RH, and the most significant promotion effect of TiO2 associated with the strongest NPF occurred at an RH of 20%. Based on the experimental evidence, the environmental impact of TiO2 on gaseous H2SO4 and particle pollution in urban areas was estimated."

Here, we established a nationwide, facility-level emission data set considering over 185,000 active boilers in China by fusing multiple data sources and jointly using various technical means. The emission uncertainties and spatial allocations were significantly improved. We found that coal-fired power plant boilers were not the most emission-intensive boilers with regard to SO2, NOx, PM, and mercury but emitted the highest CO2. However, biomass- and municipal waste-fired combustion, regarded as zerocarbon technologies, emitted a large fraction of SO2, NOx, and PM. Future biomass or municipal waste mixing in coal-fired power plant boilers can make full use of the advantages of zero-carbon fuel and the pollution control devices of coal-fired power plants. We identified small-size boilers, medium-size boilers using circulating fluidized bed boilers, and large-size boilers located in China's coal mine bases as the main high emitters. Future focuses on highemitter control can substantially mitigate the emissions of SO2 by 66%, NOx by 49%, PM by 90%, mercury by 51%, and CO2 by 46% at the most. Our study sheds light on other countries wishing to reduce their energy-related emissions and thus the related impacts on humans, ecosystems, and climates."

In this study, the changes of soil dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its relationship with microbial communities along the Hailuogou Glacier forefield chronosequence were investigated. Both microbial diversity and DOM molecular chemodiversity recovered rapidly at the initial stage, indicating the pioneering role of microorganisms in soil formation and development. The chemical stability of soil organic matter enhanced with vegetation succession due to the retaining of compounds with high oxidation state and aromaticity. The molecular composition of DOM affected microbial communities, while microorganisms tended to utilize labile components to form refractory components. This complex relationship network between microorganisms and DOM components played an important role in the development of soil organic matter as well as the formation of stable soil carbon pool in glacier-retreated areas."

However, we do not know how much these conditions affect microbial community structures and dynamics across systems over time and predictability of the treatment performance. For over a year, the microbial communities of four full-scale WWTPs processing textile wastewater were monitored. During temporal succession, the environmental conditions and system treatment performance were the main drivers, which explained up to 51% of community variations within and between all plants based on the multiple regression models. We identified the universality of community dynamics in all systems using the dissimilarity-overlap curve method, with the significant negative slopes suggesting that the communities containing the same taxa from different plants over time exhibited a similar composition dynamic. The Hubbell neutral theory and the covariance neutrality test indicated that all systems had a dominant niche-based assembly mechanism, supporting that the communities had a similar composition dynamic. Phylogenetically diverse biomarkers for the system conditions and treatment performance were identified by machine learning. Most of the biomarkers (83%) were classified as generalist taxa, and the phylogenetically related biomarkers responded similarly to the system conditions. Many biomarkers for treatment performance perform functions that are crucial for wastewater treatment processes (e.g., carbon and nutrient removal). This study clarifies the relationships between community composition and environmental conditions in full-scale WWTPs over time."	"[Yu, Jinjin; Tang, Siang Nee; Lee, Patrick K.

Unfortunately, in many machine learning spatial information enhancement algorithms, the additional spatial information introduced fails to reflect the hierarchical heterogeneity of the study area. Therefore, we designed hierarchical regionalization labels based on three interpolation techniques (inverse distance weight, ordinary kriging, and trend surface interpolation) as new spatial covariates for a machine learning (ML) model. It was demonstrated that regional spatial information improved the prediction performance of the model (R-2 > 0.7). On the basis of the prediction results, the status of HM pollution in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region was evaluated: cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) were the most serious pollutants in the PRD (the point overstandard rates are 18.77% and 12.95%, respectively). The analysis of index importance and bivariate local indicators of spatial association (LISA) shows that the key factors affecting the spatial distribution of heavy metals are geographical and climatic conditions [namely, altitude, humidity index, and normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI)] and some industrial activities (such as metal processing, printing and dyeing, and electronics industry). This study develops a novel approach to improve existing spatial interpolation techniques, which will enable more precise and scientific soil environmental management."

Its impacts on water quality, however, have remained poorly understood. Here we collate long-term (multi-year to decadal mean), baseline stream concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, two essential indicators of water quality and soil carbon response to warming, across more than 100 streams in the United States Rocky Mountains. Results show a universal pattern of higher mean concentrations in more arid mountain streams with lower mean discharge, a long-term climate measure. A watershed reactor model revealed less lateral export of dissolved carbon (via less water flow) out of the watersheds in more arid sites, leading to more accumulation and higher concentrations. Lower concentrations typically occur in cold, steep, and compact mountains with higher snow fraction and lower vegetation cover, which generally have higher discharge and carbon fluxes. Inferring from a space-for time perspective, the results indicate that as warming intensifies, lateral fluxes of dissolved carbon will decrease but concentrations will increase in these mountain streams. This indicates deteriorating water quality and potentially elevated CO2 emission directly from the land (instead of streams) in the Rockies and other mountain areas in the future climate."

Its activation under ambient conditions without using solar energy or electricity is a very interesting topic. Low valence copper (LVC) exhibits theoretical ultrahigh activity toward O-2. However, LVC is difficult to prepare and suffers from poor stability. Here, we first report a novel method for the fabrication of LVC material (P-Cu) via the spontaneous reaction of red phosphorus (P) and Cu2+. Red P, a material with excellent electron donating ability and can directly reduce Cu2+ in solution to LVC via forming Cu-P bonds. With the aid of the Cu-P bond, LVC maintains an electron-rich state and can rapidly activate O-2 to produce center dot OH. By using air, the center dot OH yield reaches a high value of 423 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is higher than traditional photocatalytic and Fenton-like systems. Moreover, the property of P-Cu is superior to that of classical nano-zero-valent copper. This work first reports the concept of spontaneous formation of LVC and develops a novel avenue for efficient O-2 activation under ambient conditions."

However, SACs with a coordination number higher than four are rarely explored, which represents a fundamental missed opportunity for coordination chemistry to boost PMS activation and degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants. We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate here that five-nitrogen-coordinated Mn (MnN5) sites more effectively activate PMS than MnN4 sites, by facilitating the cleavage of the O-O bond into high -valent Mn(IV)-oxo species with nearly 100% selectivity. The high activity of MnN5 was discerned to be due to the formation of higher-spin-state N5Mn(IV)=O species, which enable efficient two-electron transfer from organics to Mn sites through a lower-energy-barrier pathway. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of high coordination numbers in SACs for efficient PMS activation and informs the design of next-generation environmental catalysts."

Catalytic decomposition is the most efficient technology for O3 elimination, while the moisture-induced low stability represents the major challenge for its practical applications. Here, activated carbon (AC) supported delta-MnO2 (Mn/AC-A) was facilely synthesized via mild redox in an oxidizing atmosphere to obtain exceptional O3 decomposition capacity. The optimal 5Mn/AC-A achieved nearly 100% of O3 decomposition at a high space velocity (1200 L g-1 h-1) and remained extremely stable under entire humidity conditions. The functionalized AC provided well designed protection sites to inhibit the accumulation of water on delta-MnO2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that the abundant oxygen vacancies and a low desorption energy of intermediate peroxide (O22-) can significantly boost O3 decomposition activity. Moreover, a kilo-scale 5Mn/AC-A with low cost (similar to 1.5 $/kg) was used for the O3 decomposition in practical applications, which could quickly decompose O3 pollution to a safety level below 100 mu g m-3. This work offers a simple strategy for the development of moisture-resistant and inexpensive catalysts and greatly promotes the practical application of ambient O3 elimination."

As a xenobiotic signal molecule, pesticides may interact with signal transduction receptors in crops, resulting in oxidative damage and even metabolic perturbations. We discovered that three neonicotinoid insecticides (NIs), namely, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin, at 0.06-0.12 kg ai/ ha significantly inhibited the auxin signal pathway in rice leaves, thereby reducing the intracellular auxin (IAA) content. Molecular simulation further confirmed that NIs occupied the binding site where auxin transporter-like proteins 1 (LAX11) and 2 (LAX12), in which Thr253 and Asn66 of LAX11, as well as Thr244 and Asn57 of LAX12, were bound to the nitroguanidine of NIs via H -bonds. Meanwhile, Asn66 of LAX11 and Asn57 of LAX12 interacted with nitroguanidine via aromatic H-bonds. Moreover, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was significantly disturbed because of the inhibited auxin signal pathway. Notably, peroxidase-coding genes were downregulated with a maximum value greater than 10-fold, resulting in decreased antioxidant metabolites flavone (37.82%) and lignin content (20.15%). Ultimately, rice biomass was reduced by up to 25.41% due to the decline in IAA content and antioxidant capacity. This study deeply explored the molecular mechanism of metabolic perturbations in crops stressed by pesticides, thus providing a scientific basis for pesticide environmental risk assessment and agricultural product safety."

In this study, we exploited a novel AOP technology involving peracetic acid (PAA) activation mediated by a MnII-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) complex, which outperformed iron- and cobalt-based PAA activation processes for rapidly degrading phenolic and aniline contaminants from water. The proposed MnII/NTA/PAA system exhibited non-radical oxidation features and could stoichiometrically oxidize sulfoxide probes to the corresponding sulfone products. More importantly, we traced the origin of O atoms from the sulfone products by 18O isotope-tracing experiments and found that PAA was the only oxygen-donor, which is different from the oxidation process mediated by high-valence manganese-oxo intermediates. According to the results of theoretical calculations, we proposed that NTA could tune the coordination circumstance of the MnII center to elongate the O-O bond of the complexed PAA. Additionally, the NTA-MnII-PAA* molecular cluster presented a lower energy gap than the MnII-PAA complex, indicating that the MnII-peroxy complex was more reactive in the presence of NTA. Thus, the NTA-MnII-PAA* complex exhibited a stronger oxidation potential than PAA, which could rapidly oxidize organic contaminants from water. Further, we generalized our findings to the CoII/PAA oxidation process and highlighted that the CoII- PAA* complex might be the overlooked reactive cobalt species. The significance of this work lies in discovering that sometimes the metal-peroxy complex could directly oxidize the contaminants without the further generation of high-valence metal-oxo intermediates and/or radical species through interspecies oxygen and/or electron transfer."

However, conventional reducing agents such as hydroxylamine and metal sulfides are greatly restricted by three intractable challenges: (1) self-quenching effects, (2) heavy metal dissolution, and (3) irreversible capacity decline. To this end, we, for the first time, introduced redox-active polymers as electron shuttles to expedite the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle and promote H2O2 activation. The reduction of Fe3+ mainly took place at active N- H or O-H bonds through a proton-coupled electron transfer process. As electron carriers, H atoms at the solid phase could effectively inhibit radical quenching, avoid metal dissolution, and maintain long-term reducing capacity via facile regeneration. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicated that the activity of different polymers shows a volcano curve trend as a function of the energy barrier, highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap, and vertical ionization potential. Thanks to the appropriate redox ability, polyaniline outperforms other redox-active polymers (e.g., poypyrrole, hydroquinone resin, poly(2,6-diaminopyridine), and hexaazatrinaphthalene framework) with a highest iron reduction capacity up to 5.5 mmol/g, which corresponds to the state transformation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine. Moreover, the proposed system exhibited high pollutant removal efficiency in a flow-through reactor for 8000 bed volumes without an obvious decline in performance. Overall, this work established a green and sustainable oxidation system, which offers great potential for practical organic wastewater remediation."

The PFHxS contamination of drinking water always results from direct and indirect sources, especially the secondary generations through environmental transformations of precursors. However, the mechanism of the transformation of precursors to PFHXS during the drinking water treatment processes remains unclear. Herein, the potential precursors and formation mechanisms of PFHxS were explored during drinking water disinfection. Simultaneously, the factors affecting PFHxS generation were also examined. This study found PFHxS could be generated from polyfluoroalkyl sulfonamide derivatives during chlorination and chloramination. The fate and yield of PFHxS varied from different precursors and disinfection processes. In particular, monochloramine more favorably formed PFHxS. Several perfluoroalkyl oxidation products and decarboxylation intermediates were detected and identified in the chloraminated samples using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Combined with density functional theory calculations, the results indicated that the indirect oxidation via the attack of the nitrogen atom in sulfonamide groups might be the dominant pathway for generating PFHxS during chloramination, and the process could be highly affected by the monochloramine dose, pH, and temperature. This study provides important evidence of the secondary formation of PFHxS during drinking water disinfection and scientific support for chemical management of PFHxS and PFHxS-related compounds."

We propose a method that classifies HRMS data based on the differences in the number of elements between each pair of molecular formulae within the formulae list to preserve the essence of the given sample. The novel metric, formulae difference chains expected length (FDCEL), allowed for comparing and classifying samples measured by different instruments. We also demonstrate a web application and a prototype for a uniform database for HRMS data serving as a benchmark for future biogeochemical and environmental applications.

However, it suffers from sluggish kinetics and noble-metal catalyst requirement. Here, we report a non-precious ultrathin NiFe-layered double hydroxide catalyst for the remarkable conversion of urea into N2 and H2 , which is in situ grown on a Ni foam via ultrasonic self-etching in Fe3+/ethylene glycol (EG). EG regulates the etching rate of Fe3+ , resulting in an ultrathin nanosheet structure with the aid of ultrasonication. This structure dramatically promotes the dehydrogenation process via decreasing the nanolayer thickness from 120 to 3.4 nm and leads to a 4.8-fold increase in the generation of active sites. It exhibits record urea oxidation kinetics (390.8 mAmiddotcm(-2) at 1.5 V vs RHE) with excellent stability (120 h), which is 11.8 times better than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst (33.1 mAmiddotcm(-2)). Tests with real urine at 20 mA cm(-2) achieve 74% total nitrogen removal and 2853 mu molmiddoth(-1) of H-2 production.

However, the temper-ature-dependent evolution and MPPVC-interaction of DBC molecules remain unclear. Herein, we propose a novel DBC-MPPVC interaction mechanism by systematically interpreting heterogeneous correlations, sequential responses, and synergistic relationships of thousands of molecules and their linking functional groups. Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy was proposed to combine Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and spectroscopic datasets. Increased temperature caused diverse DBC molecules and fluorophores, accompanied by molecular transformation from saturation/reduction to unsaturation/oxidation with high carbon oxidation states, especially for molecules with acidic functional groups. The temperature response of DBC molecules detected via negative-/positive-ion electrospray ionization sequentially occurred in unsaturated hydrocarbons -> lignin-like -> condensed aromatic -> lipid-/aliphatic-/ peptide-like -> tannin-like -> carbohydrate-like molecules. DBC molecular changes induced by temperature and MPPVC interaction were closely coordinated, with lignin-like molecules contributing the most to the interaction. Functional groups in DBC molecules with m/z < 500 showed a sequential MPPVC-interaction response of phenol/aromatic ether C-O, alkene C=C/amide C=O -> polysaccharides C-O -> alcohol/ether/carbohydrate C-O groups. These findings help to elucidate the critical role of DBCs in MP environmental behaviors."

Aminoglycosides are refractory antibiotics that are generally considered non-biodegradable. Here, we provide evidence that kanamycin, a common aminoglycoside antibiotic, can be degraded by an environmental bacterium through deglycosylation of its 4 '-amino sugar. The unprecedented deglycosylation inactivation of kanamycin is initiated by a novel periplasmic dehydrogenase complex, which we designated AquKGD, composed of a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent dehydrogenase (AquKGD alpha) and a small subunit (AquKGD gamma) containing a twin-arginine signal sequence. We demonstrate that the formation of the AquKGD alpha-AquKGD gamma complex is required for both the degradation activity of AquKGD and its translocation into the periplasm. Native AquKGD was successfully expressed in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli, and physicochemical analysis indicated that AquKGD is a stable enzyme. AquKGD showed excellent degradation performance, and complete elimination of kanamycin from actual kanamycin manufacturing waste was achieved with immobilized AquKGD. Ecotoxicity and cytotoxicity tests suggest that AquKGD-mediated degradation produces less harmful degradation products. Thus, we propose a novel enzymatic antibiotic inactivation strategy for effective and safe treatment of recalcitrant kanamycin residues."

Anaerobic consortia that can biohydrogenate BD to stoichiometric amounts of 1-butene at a maximum rate of 205.7 +/- 38.6 mu M day(-1) were derived from freshwater river sediment. The formation of 1-butene occurred only in the presence of both H-2 and CO2 with concomitant acetate production, suggesting the dependence of BD biohydrogenation on acetogenesis. The 16S rRNA gene-targeted amplicon sequencing revealed the enrichment and dominance of a novel Acetobacterium wieringae population, designated as strain N, in the BDbiohydrogenating community. Multiple genes encoding putative ene-reductases, candidate catalysts for the hydrogenation of the C=C bond in diene compounds, were annotated on the metagenomeassembled genome of strain N, and thus attributed the BD biohydrogenation activity to strain N. Our findings emphasize an essential but overlooked role of certain Acetobacterium members (e.g., strain N) contributing to the natural attenuation of BD in contaminated subsurface environments (e.g., sediment and groundwater). Future efforts to identify and characterize the ene-reductase(s) responsible for BD biohydrogenation in strain N hold promise for the development of industrial biocatalysts capable of stereoselective conversion of BD to 1-butene."

However, whether the operation period of solar parks can increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in hosting natural ecosystems has not been fully considered. Here, we conducted a field experiment to compensate for the lack of evaluation of the effects of PV array deployment on GHG emissions. Our results show that the PV arrays caused significant differences in air microclimate, soil properties, and vegetation characteristics. Simultaneously, PV arrays had more significant effects on CO2 and N2O emissions but a minor impact on CH4 uptake in the growing season. Of all the environmental variables included, soil temperature and moisture were the main drivers of GHG flux variation. The sustained flux global warming potential from the PV arrays significantly increased by 8.14% compared to the ambient grassland. Our evaluation models identified that the GHG footprint of PV arrays during the operation period on grasslands was 20.62 g CO2-eq kW h-1. Compared with our model estimates, GHG footprint estimates reported in previous studies were generally less by 25.46-50.76%. The contribution of PV power generation to GHG reduction may be overestimated without considering the impact of PV arrays on hosting ecosystems."

Multimodal microspectroscopy analysis during the background case reveals a broadening of chemically specific size distribution above the cloud top with a high abundance of sulfate particles and core-shell morphology, suggesting possible cloud processing of aerosols.

The low-temperature activity of Cu-KFI catalysts was restrained by the formation of H2SO4 and then CuSO4 after sulfur poisoning. Hydrothermally aged Cu-KFI exhibited better SO2 resistance than fresh Cu-KFI since HTA significantly reduced the number of Brunsted acid sites, which were considered to be the H2SO4 storage sites. The high-temperature activity of SO2-poisoned Cu-KFI was basically unchanged compared to the fresh catalyst. However, SO2 poisoning promoted the high-temperature activity of hydrothermally aged Cu-KFI since it triggered CuOx into CuSO4 species, which was considered as an important role in the NH3-SCR reaction at high temperatures.

Here, the dynamics of cyanobacterial EPS-associated phosphorus (EPS-P) were examined both in a shallow eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu, China) and in laboratory experiments with respect to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability. Results indicated that 40-65% of the total cyanobacterial aggregate/particulate P presented as EPS-P (mainly labile P and Fe/Al-P). Phosphorus-starved cyanobacteria rapidly replenished their EPS-P pools after the P was resupplied, and the P concentration in this pool was stable for long afterward, although the environmental P concentration decreased dramatically. A low-N treatment enhanced the EPS production alongside two-fold EPS-P accumulation (particularly labile P) higher than the control. Such patterns occurred in the lake where EPS and EPS-P contents were high under N limitation. EPS-P enrichment increased the P content in cyanobacteria; subsequently, it could hold the total P concentration higher for longer and make bloom mitigation harder. The findings outline a new insight into EPS functions in the P process of cyanobacterial aggregates and encourage consideration of both N and P reductions in nutrient management."

Energy storage will become increasingly important as intermittent renewable generation and more frequent extreme weather events put stress on the electricity grid. Environmental groups across the United States are advocating for the replacement of the highest emitting power plants, which run only at times of peak demand, with Li-ion battery systems. We analyze the life-cycle cost, climate, and human health impacts of replacing the 19 highest-emitting peaker plants in California with Li-ion battery energy storage systems (BESS). Our results show that designing Li-ion BESS to replace peaker plants puts them at an economic disadvantage, even if facilities are only sized to meet 95% of the original plants' load events and are free to engage in arbitrage. However, five of 19 potential replacements do achieve a positive net present value after including monetized climate and human health impacts. These BESS cycle far less than typical front-of-the-meter batteries and rely on the frequency regulation market for most of their revenue.

However, relatively little is known about microbially mediated vanadate [V(V)] reduction characteristics driven by pyrrhotite and concomitant mineral dynamics in this process. This study demonstrated efficient V(V) bioreduction during 210 d of operation, with a lifespan about 10 times longer than abiotic control, especially in a stable period when the V(V) removal efficiency reached 44.1 +/- 13.8%. Pyrrhotite oxidation coupled to V(V) reduction could be achieved by an enriched single autotroph (e.g., Thiobacillus and Thermomonas) independently. Autotrophs (e.g., Sulfurifustis) gained energy from pyrrhotite oxidation to synthesize organic intermediates, which were utilized by the heterotrophic V(V) reducing bacteria such as Anaerolinea, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas to sustain V(V) reduction. V(V) was reduced to insoluble tetravalent V, while pyrrhotite oxidation mainly produced Fe(III) and SO42-. Secondary minerals including mackinawite (FeS) and greigite (Fe3S4) were produced synchronously, resulting from further transformations of Fe(III) and SO42- by sulfate reducing bacteria (e.g., Desulfatiglans) and magnetotactic bacteria (e.g., Nitrospira). This study provides new insights into the biogeochemical behavior of V under pyrrhotite effects and reveals the previously overlooked mineralogical dynamics in V(V) reduction bioprocesses driven by Fe(II)-bearing minerals."

We aim to reveal the mechanisms of immunotoxicity of different PFASs and hypothesize that PFAS immunotoxicity is dependent on the carbon chain length. Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) representing different carbon chain lengths (4-9) at environmentally relevant levels strongly reduced the host's antibacterial ability during the zebrafish's early-life stage. Innate and adaptive immunities were both suppressed after PFAS exposures, exhibiting a significant induction of macrophages and neutrophils and expression of immune-related genes and indicators. Interestingly, the PFAS-induced immunotoxic responses were positively correlated to the carbon chain length. Moreover, PFASs activated downstream genes of the toll-like receptor (TLR), uncovering a seminal role of TLR in PFAS immunomodulatory effects. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) morpholino knock-down experiments and MyD88 inhibitors alleviated the immunotoxicity of PFASs. Overall, the comparative results demonstrate differences in the immunotoxic responses of PFASs due to carbon chain length in zebrafish, providing new insights into the prediction and classification of PFASs mode of toxic action based on carbon chain length."

Here, we provide direct evidence that microbial necromass carbon is a major component of lost carbon in a retrogressive permafrost thaw slump by analyzing soil organic carbon (SOC), biomarkers (amino sugars and lignin phenols), and soil environmental variables in a typical permafrost thaw slump in the Tibetan Plateau. The retrogressive thaw slump led to a similar to 61% decrease in SOC and a similar to 25% SOC stock loss. As evident in the levels of amino sugars (average of 55.92 +/- 18.79 mg g-1 of organic carbon, OC) and lignin phenols (average of 15.00 +/- 8.05 mg g-1 OC), microbial-derived carbon (microbial necromass carbon) was the major component of the SOC loss, accounting for similar to 54% of the SOC loss in the permafrost thaw slump. The variation of amino sugars was mainly related to the changes in soil moisture, pH, and plant input, while changes in lignin phenols were mainly related to the changes in soil moisture and soil bulk density."

Here, we show the concurrent measurements of 73 individual PAHs and environmental data, including the composition of the bacterial community, during three austral summers at coastal Livingston (2015 and 2018) and Deception (2017) islands (Antarctica). The Livingston 2015 campaign was characterized by a larger snow melting input of PAHs and nutrients. The assessment of PAH diagnostic ratios, such as parent to alkyl-PAHs or LMW to HMW PAHs, showed that there was a larger biodegradation during the Livingston 2015 campaign than in the Deception 2017 and Livingston 2018 campaigns. The biogeochemical cycling, including microbial degradation, was thus yearly dependent on snow-derived inputs of matter, including PAHs, consistent with the microbial community significantly different between the different campaigns. The bivariate correlations between bacterial taxa and PAH concentrations showed that a decrease in PAH concentrations was concurrent with the higher abundance of some bacterial taxa, specifically the order Pseudomonadales in the class Gammaproteobacteria, known facultative hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria previously reported in degradation studies of oil spills. The work shows the potential for elucidation of biogeochemical processes by intensive field-derived time series, even in the harsh and highly variable Antarctic environment."

We conducted the largest study of CH4 emissions from US wastewater treatment, measuring 63 plants with average daily flows ranging from 4.2 x 10-4 to 8.5 m3 s-1 (<0.1 to 193 MGD), totaling 2% of the 62.5 billion gallons treated, nationally. We employed Bayesian inference to quantify facility-integrated emission rates with a mobile laboratory approach (1165 cross-plume transects). The median plant-averaged emission rate was 1.1 g CH4 s-1 (0.1-21.6 g CH4 s-1; 10th/90th percentiles; mean 7.9 g CH4 s-1), and the median emission factor was 3.4 x 10-2 g CH4 (g influent 5 day biochemical oxygen demand; BOD5)-1 [0.6-9.9 x 10-2 g CH4 (g BOD5)-1; 10th/90th percentiles; mean 5.7 x 10-2 g CH4 (g BOD5)-1]. Using a Monte Carlo-based scaling of measured emission factors, emissions from US centrally treated domestic wastewater are 1.9 (95% CI: 1.5-2.4) times greater than the current US EPA inventory (bias of 5.4 MMT CO2-eq). With increasing urbanization and centralized treatment, efforts to identify and mitigate CH4 emissions are needed."

In this study, an ozone/percarbonate (O3/SPC) process was proposed to efficiently decomplex Cu(II)-EDTA and simultaneously recover Cu. The results demonstrate that the O3/SPC process achieves 100% recovery of Cu with the corresponding kobs value of 0.103 min-1 compared with the typical center dot OH-based O3/H2O2 process (81.2%, 0.042 min-1). The carbonate radical anion (CO3 center dot-) is generated from the O3/SPC process and carries out the targeted attack of amino groups of Cu(II)-EDTA for decarboxylation and deamination processes, resulting in successive cleavage of Cu-O and Cu-N bonds. In comparison, the center dot OH-based O3/H2O2 process is predominantly responsible for the breakage of Cu-O bonds via decarboxylation and formic acid removal. Moreover, the released Cu(II) can be transformed into stable copper precipitates by employing an endogenous precipitant (CO32-), accompanied by toxic-free byproducts in the O3/SPC process. More importantly, the O3/SPC process exhibits excellent metal recovery in the treatment of real copper electroplating wastewater and other metal-EDTA complexes. This study provides a promising technology and opens a new avenue for the efficient decomplexation of metal-organic complexes with simultaneous recovery of valuable metal resources."

In this study, the feasibility of epsilon-poly -L-lysine (e-PL) as a novel natural ammonia oxidation inhibitor was investigated. Significant inhibition (ammonia oxidation inhibition rate was up to 96.83%) was achieved by treating the sludge with e-PL (400 mg/L, 12 h soaking) only once and maintaining for six cycles. Meanwhile, the organic matter and nitrite removal was not affected. This method was effective under the common environmental conditions of biological wastewater treatment. Metatranscriptome uncovered the possible action mechanisms of e-PL. The ammonia oxidation inhibition was due to the co-decrease of Nitrosomonas abundance, ammonia oxidation genes, and the cellular responses of Nitrosomonas. Thauera and Dechloromonas could adapt to e PL by stimulating stress responses, which maintained the organic matter and nitrite removal. Importantly, e-PL did not cause the enhancement of antibiotic resistance genes and virulent factors. Therefore, e-PL showed a great potential of ammonia retention, which could be applied in the biological treatment of wastewater for agricultural reuse."

A promising oxidation technology better suited for these applications is that of electro-oxidation (EO), whereby contaminants are degraded via direct, advanced, and/or electrosynthesized oxidant-mediated reactions. One species of oxidants of particular interest includes ferrates (Fe(VI)/(V)/ (IV)), where only recently has their circumneutral synthesis been demonstrated, using high oxygen overpotential (HOP) electrodes, namely boron-doped diamond (BDD). In this study, the generation of ferrates using various HOP electrodes (BDD, NAT/Ni-Sb- SnO2, and AT/Sb-SnO2) was investigated. Ferrate synthesis was pursued in a current density range of 5-15 mA cm-2 and initial Fe3+ concentrations of 10-15 mM. Faradaic efficiencies ranged from 11-23%, depending on operating conditions, with BDD and NAT significantly outperforming AT electrodes. Speciation tests revealed that NAT synthesizes both ferrate(IV/V) and ferrate(VI), while the BDD and AT electrodes synthesized only ferrate(IV/V) species. A number of organic scavenger probes were used to test the relative reactivity, including nitrobenzene, carbamazepine, and fluconazole, whereby ferrate(IV/V) was significantly more oxidative than ferrate(VI). Finally, the ferrate(VI) synthesis mechanism by NAT electrolysis was elucidated, where coproduction of ozone was found to be a key phenomenon for Fe3+ oxidation to ferrate(VI)."

The wide variation and complex chemistries of liquid nuclear waste streams containing 99Tc often create unique, site specific challenges when sequestering and immobilizing the waste in a matrix suitable for long-term storage and disposal. Therefore, an effective management plan for 99Tc containing liquid radioactive wastes (such as storage (tanks) and decommissioned wastes) will likely require a variety of suitable materials/matrixes capable of adapting to and addressing these challenges. In this review, we discuss and highlight the key developments for effective removal and immobilization of 99Tc liquid waste in inorganic waste forms. Specifically, we review the synthesis, characterization, and application of materials for the targeted removal of 99Tc from (simulated) waste solutions under various experimental conditions. These materials include (i) layered double hydroxides (LDHs), (ii) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), (iii) ion-exchange resins (IERs) as well as cationic organic polymers (COPs), (iv) surface modified natural clay materials (SMCMs), and (v) graphene-based materials (GBMs). Second, we discuss some of the major and recent developments toward 99Tc immobilization in (i) glass, (ii) cement, and (iii) iron mineral waste forms. Finally, we present future challenges that need to be addressed for the design, synthesis, and selection of suitable matrixes for the efficient sequestration and immobilization of 99Tc from targeted wastes. The purpose of this review is to inspire research on the design and application of various suitable materials/matrixes for selective removal of 99Tc present globally in different radioactive wastes and its immobilization in stable/durable waste forms."

Here, we developed an Fe-based metal-organic framework (MOF) with a ferrocene (Fc) redox-active bridge (termed Fe-MIL-88B-Fc) for the highly selective removal of As(III) from water. At a cell voltage of 1.2 V, Fe-MIL-88B-Fc can selectively separate and oxidize As(III) into the less harmful As(V) state in the presence of a 100-to 1250-fold excess of competing electrolyte, with an uptake capacity of >110 mg-As g-1 adsorbent. The high affinity between the uncharged As(III) and the mu 3-O trimer (-36.55 kcal mol-1) in Fe-MIL88B-Fc and the electron transfer between As(III) and redox-active Fc+ synergistically govern the selective capture and conversion of arsenic. The Fe-based MOF demonstrates high selectivity and capacity to remediate arsenic-contaminated natural water at a low energy cost (0.025 kWh m-3).

In this paper, the effects of phosphorus on Cu-SSZ-39 catalysts before and after hydrothermal aging treatment were investigated. Compared with fresh Cu-SSZ-39 catalysts, phosphorus poisoning significantly decreased the low-temperature NH3-SCR catalytic activity. However, such activity loss was alleviated by further hydrothermal aging treatment. To reveal the reason for this interesting result, a variety of characterization techniques including NMR, H2-TPR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, NH3-TPD, and in situ DRIFTS measurements were employed. It was found that Cu-P species produced by phosphorus poisoning decreased the redox ability of active copper species, resulting in the observed low-temperature deactivation. After hydrothermal aging treatment, however, Cu-P species partly decomposed with the formation of active CuOx species and a release of active copper species. As a result, the low-temperature NH3-SCR catalytic activity of Cu-SSZ-39 catalysts was recovered."

A microcosm incubation study with Arctic tundra soil over 145 days demonstrates that N2O at 0.1 and 1 mM markedly inhibited microbial MeHg formation, methanogenesis, and sulfate reduction, while it slightly promoted CO2 production. Microbial community analyses indicate that N2O decreased the relative abundances of methanogenic archaea and microbial clades implicated in sulfate reduction and MeHg formation. Following depletion of N2O, both MeHg formation and sulfate reduction rapidly resumed, whereas CH4 production remained low, suggesting that N2O affected susceptible microbial guilds differently. MeHg formation strongly coincided with sulfate reduction, supporting prior reports linking sulfate-reducing bacteria to MeHg formation in the Arctic soil. This research highlights complex biogeochemical interactions in governing MeHg and CH4 formation and lays the foundation for future mechanistic studies for improved predictive understanding of MeHg and greenhouse gas fluxes from thawing permafrost ecosystems."

A novel approach combining different scientific disciplines has addressed this topic. Acute (mortality) and sublethal effects (i.e., fitness, neurological, immunological, and oxidative responses) of exposure of northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) were studied in laboratory experiments. Passive water sampling combined with sediment analyses revealed environmental concentrations. Finally, dispersal modeling was performed to predict environmental concentrations. Ecotoxicological analyses showed mortality in shrimp after 1 h of exposure to 2 ng L-1 (1000-fold dilution of treatment dose), revealing a high sensitivity to deltamethrin. Sublethal effects included induction of acetylcholinesterase and acyl CoA oxidase activities and oxidative impairment, which may be linked to neurotoxic responses. Field concentrations of 10-200 ng L-1 in water (100 m from the pens) and < LOD-0.19ng g(-1) dw in sediment(0-400m from pens) were measured. Ecotoxicological values were compared with measured and modeled concentrations. They showed that concentrations higher than those causing mortality could be expected up to 4-5 km from point of release, in an area of 6.4 km2, with lethal concentrations remaining up to 35 h in some areas. Hence, the study demonstrates that there is a considerable risk for negative effects on the ecologically and commercially important shrimp."

However, the high-activity origin and mechanism underlying intrinsic activity enhancement remain elusive, especially for the Fenton-like reaction. Herein, we systematically compared the catalytic performance of dual-atom FeCo-N/C with its single-atom counterparts by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for pollutant abatement. The unusual spin-state reconstruction on FeCo-N/C is demonstrated to effectively improve the electronic structure of Fe and Co in the d orbital and enhance the PMS activation efficiency. Accordingly, the dual-atom FeCo-N/C with an intermediate-spin state remarkably boosts the Fenton-like reaction by almost 1 order of magnitude compared with low-spin Co-N/C and high-spin Fe-N/C. Moreover, the established dual-atom activated PMS system also exhibits excellent stability and robust resistance against harsh conditions. Combined theoretical calculations reveal that unlike unitary Co atom or Fe atom transferring electrons to the PMS molecule, the Fe atom of FeCo-N/C provides extra electrons to the neighboring Co atom and positively shifts the d band of the Co center, thereby optimizing the PMS adsorption and decomposition into a unique high-valent FeIV-O-CoIV species via a low-energy barrier pathway. This work advances a conceptually novel mechanistic understanding of the enhanced catalytic activity of DACs in Fenton-like reactions and helps to expand the application of DACs in various catalytic reactions."

While Zn itself is not redox-active in soils, transitions in soil redox conditions may promote mobilization of Zn from common Zn hosts, including Mn(IV)/ Fe(III)-(hydr)oxides and sulfide precipitates, leading to elevated concentrations of dissolved Zn in surface and groundwater and thus a potential increase in Zn transport and uptake. Here, we examined the impacts of hydrologic fluctuations and coupled redox transitions on Zn partitioning in contaminated riparian soil in a mountain watershed. We found that oxygenation of the soil profile during low water conditions caused a spike in porewater Zn concentrations, driven by oxidative dissolution of amorphous ZnS and weak partitioning of Zn to Fe(III)-(hydr)oxides, hydroxy-interlayer vermiculite, and vermiculite. In contrast to Pb, released Zn did not immediately adsorb to Fe(III)-(hydr)oxides or particulate organic matter due to less-favorable sorption of Zn than that of Pb and, further, decreased Zn sorption at slightly acidic pH. As aridification intensifies and groundwater levels decline throughout the western United States, contaminated floodplain soils in mountain watersheds may be frequently oxygenated, leading to increased mobilization of dissolved Zn, which will amplify the threat Zn poses to water quality and ecosystem health."

However, they are still unknown. Herein, simultaneous catalytic decomposition of methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) and ethyl mercaptan (C2H5SH) is investigated over lanthanum (La)-modified ZSM-5, and kinetic and thermodynamic results confirm a great difference in the adsorption property and catalytic transformation behavior. Meanwhile, the new synergistic reaction and deactivation mechanisms are revealed at the molecular level by combining with in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The CH3CH2* and SH* groups are presented in decomposing C2H5SH, while the new species of CH2*, active H* and S*, instead of CH3* and SH*, are proved as the key elementary groups in decomposing CH3SH. The competitive recombining of SH* in C2H5SH with highly active H* in dimethyl sulfide (CH3SCH3), an intermediate in decomposing CH3SH, would aggravate the deposition of carbon and sulfur. La/ZSM-5 exhibits potential environmental application due to the excellent stability of 200 h and water resistance. This work gives an understanding of the adsorption, catalysis, reaction, and deactivation mechanisms for decomposing double components of sulfur-containing VOCs."

However, research regarding this topic has not been systematically reviewed, especially in terms of communitylevel responses. In this review, we provide an overview of current antibiotic pollution in aquatic environments worldwide. Then, we summarize recent studies concerning the responses of planktonic communities to antibiotics, ranging from individual- to community-level responses. Studies have shown that extremely high concentrations of antibiotics can directly harm the growth and survival of plankton; however, such concentrations are rarely found in natural freshwater. It is more likely that environmentally relevant concentrations of antibiotics will affect the physiological, morphological, and behavioral characteristics of planktonic organisms; influence interspecific interactions among plankton species via asymmetrical responses in species traits; and thus alter the structure and function of the entire planktonic ecosystem. This review highlights the importance of community analysis in revealing antibiotic toxicity. We also encourage the establishment of the causal relationships between impacts at multiple scales in the future for predicting the community-level consequences of antibiotics based on the currently available individual-level evidence."

The cultivation of dedicated crops for BECCS impacts the temperature through two processes: net CO2 removal (CDR) from the atmosphere (biogeochemical cooling) and changes in the local energy balance (biophysical warming or cooling). Here, we compare the magnitude of these two processes for key grass and tree species envisioned for large-scale bioenergy crop cultivation, following economically plausible scenarios using Earth System Models. By the end of this century, the cumulative CDR from the cultivation of eucalypt (72-112 Pg C) is larger than that of switchgrass (34-83 Pg C) because of contrasting contributions of land use change carbon emissions. The combined biogeochemical and biophysical effects are cooling (-0.26 to -0.04 degrees C) at the global scale, but 13-28% of land areas still have net warming signals, mainly due to the spatial heterogeneity of the biophysical effects. Our study shows that the deployment of bioenergy crop cultivation should not only be guided by the principles of maximizing yield and CDR but should also take an integrated perspective that includes all relevant Earth system feedbacks."

However, sluggish reaction kinetics and significant side reactions considerably limit the applicability of this green process. Herein, we uncovered the previously ignored role of interfacial hydrophilicity in determining the ER performance through electron microscopy observations, contact angle (CA) analysis, and electrochemical measurements. A Pd/C electrocatalyst forms dense nanopores on the electrode surface, rendering it highly hydrophobic and achieving a CA of up to 145 degrees. This imposes a large mass-transfer barrier for the diffusion of water and pollutants into Pd sites. Moreover, the release of H2 is suppressed, which changes the solid-liquid (Pd-polluted water) interface into a solid-gas (H2)-liquid interface. This further slows down mass transfer and the decontamination process. This dilemma can be easily alleviated by adding hydrophilic polymers like polyethylene glycol to increase hydrophilicity and improve mass transfer. By this way, the activity and Faraday efficiency of Pd/C in the electrochemical hydrodehalogenation of 2,4-dichlorophenol could be increased by 4-5 times. Moreover, this interfacial microenvironment modulation strategy is parallel to other approaches, such as Pd structural engineering, and therefore these strategies can be combined to further increase the electrochemical decontamination performance of electrocatalysts."

To identify the thermal decomposition products and mechanisms of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), gaseous perfluoropropionic acid (PFPrA) and perfluorobutyric acid (PFBA) were decomposed in nitrogen and oxygen at temperatures from 200 to 780 degrees C. In nitrogen (i.e., pyrolysis), the primary products of PFPrA were CF2=CF2, CF3CF2H, and CF3COF. CF3CF=CF2 was the dominant product of PFBA. These products are produced by HF elimination (detected as low as 200 degrees C). CF4 and C2F6 were observed from both PFCAs, suggesting formation of perfluorocarbon radical intermediates. Pyrolysis products were highly thermally stable, resulting in poor defluorination. In oxygen (i.e., combustion), the primary product of both PFPrA and PFBA below 400 degrees C was COF2, but the primary product was SiF4 above 600 degrees C due to reactions with the quartz reactor. Oxygen facilitated thermal defluorination by reacting with PFCAs and with pyrolysis products (i.e., fluoroolefins and fluorocarbon radicals). Platinum improved combustion of PFCAs to COF2 at temperatures as low as 200 degrees C, while quartz promoted the combustion of PFCAs into SiF4 at higher temperatures (>600 degrees C), highlighting the importance of surface reactions that are not typically incorporated into computational approaches."

To address this knowledge gap, we measured the reduction rates of MCs and their surrogates including nitroaromatics [NACs; 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN), 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-A-DNT), 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-A-DNT), and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT)], nitramines [hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and nitroguanidine (NQ)], and azoles [3-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO) and 3,4-dinitropyrazole (DNP)] by three dithionite-reduced quinones (lawsone, AQDS, and AQS). All MCs/NACs were reduced by the hydroquinones except NQ. Hydroquinone and MC speciations were varied by controlling pH, permitting the application of a speciation model to determine second-order rate constants (k) from observed pseudo-first-order rate constants. The intrinsic reactivity of MCs (oxidants) decreased upon deprotonation, while the opposite was true for hydroquinones (reductants). The rate constants spanned similar to 6 orders of magnitude in the order NTO TNT > DNP > DNT DNAN 2-A-DNT > DNP- > 4-A-DNT > NTO- > RDX. LFERs developed using density functional theory-calculated electron transfer and hydrogen atom transfer energies and reported one-electron reduction potentials successfully predicted k, suggesting that these structurally diverse MCs/NACs are all reduced by hydroquinones through the same mechanism and rate-limiting step. These results increase the applicability of LFER models for predicting the fate and half-lives of MCs and related nitro compounds in reducing environments."

Thus, the design of OA catalysts with adequate reactivity, durability, and selectivity is critical but challenging. Here, we report a CuxO@C core@shell photoelectrode prepared by encapsulating Cu/Cu2O/CuO into a carbon layer through anodic electropolymerization (electrophoresis-coupled self-assembly of carbon quantum dots). Theoretical prediction and experiments indicate that the carbon layer can effectively facilitate optical trapping and charge transfer, thus promoting photoelectric conversion and anti-photocorrosion performance of CuxO@ C. The inner CuxO core acts as an electron reservoir and continuously injects electrons into the outer carbon layer shell, and the carbon atoms adjacent to oxygen-enriched functional groups (C-O-C and -COOH) in the electron-rich carbon layer work as the reactive sites to adsorb O2 and donate electrons to the antibonding orbital [lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (pi*)] of dioxygen. Optimized adsorption and hydrogenation of the critical intermediates (*O2, *OOH, and *H2O2) and thermodynamically tunable O-O bond cleavage enable O2 being selectively reduced to the superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical via the mixed multielectron processes consisting of one-and three-electron pathways. Sulfamethoxazole, an emerging refractory organic contaminant widely present in the environment, can be effectively degraded (similar to 100% removal) in such an electrochemical platform, benefiting from the abundant ROS generated in situ. Our findings demonstrate an innovative strategy to develop highly efficient and selective OA catalysts for practical water purification."

Prior studies have primarily focused on the control of agricultural NH3 emissions, the dominant source of anthropogenic NH3 emissions. The air quality impact from vehicular NH3 emissions, which could be particularly important in urban areas, has not been adequately evaluated. We developed high-resolution vehicular NH3 emission inventories for Beijing and Shanghai based on detailed link-level traffic profiles and conducted atmospheric simulations of ambient PM2.5 concentrations contributed by vehicular NH3 emissions. We found that vehicular NH3 emissions shared high proportions among total anthropogenic NH3 emissions in the urban areas of Beijing (86%) and Shanghai (45%), where vehicular NH3 was primarily emitted by gasoline vehicles. Local vehicular NH3 emissions could be responsible for approximately 3% of urban PM2.5 concentrations during wintertime, and the contributions could be much higher during polluted periods (similar to 3 mu g m-3). We also showed that controlling vehicular NH3 emissions will be effective and feasible to alleviate urban PM2.5 pollution for megacities in the near future."

Peptide-bound lysine and arginine are two of the seven chlorine-reactive amino acids, but their reactions with chlorine are poorly characterized. Using N-acetylated lysine and arginine as models for peptide-bound amino acids and authentic small peptides, this study demonstrated conversion of the lysine side chain to mono-and dichloramines and the arginine side chain to mono-, di-, and trichloramines in <= 0.5 h. The lysine chloramines formed lysine nitrile and lysine aldehyde at similar to 6% yield over similar to 1 week. The arginine chloramines formed ornithine nitrile at similar to 3% yield over similar to 1 week but not the corresponding aldehyde. While researchers hypothesized that the protein aggregation observed during chlorination arises from covalent Schiff base cross-links between lysine aldehyde and lysine on different proteins, no evidence for Schiff base formation was observed. The rapid formation of chloramines and their slow decay indicate that they are more relevant than the aldehydes and nitriles to byproduct formation and pathogen inactivation over timescales relevant to drinking water distribution. Previous research has indicated that lysine chloramines are cytotoxic and genotoxic to human cells. The conversion of lysine and arginine cationic side chains to neutral chloramines should alter protein structure and function and enhance protein aggregation by hydrophobic interactions, contributing to pathogen inactivation."

Computational and experimental results demonstrate that the optimized electron transport pathway included intercrystal electron transfer induced by the La-O bond between Ag2O and La(OH)3 as well as electron transfer between the catalyst crystal and electrophilic PAN membrane interface. In addition, the photo-catalytic performance of the Ag2O/La(OH)3 membrane for tetracycline (TC) removal was still above 97% after five photocatalytic reaction cycles. Furthermore, the carrier life was greatly extended. Mechanistic study revealed that photogenerated holes on the Ag2O/La(OH)3 membrane were the main reactive species in TC degradation.

However, data regarding the environmental behavior of PCDEs in aquatic ecosystems are lacking. In the present study, a simulated aquatic food chain (Scenedesmus obliquus- Daphnia magna-Danio rerio) was constructed in a lab setting, and the bioaccumulation, trophic transfer, and biotransformation of 12 PCDE congeners were quantitatively investigated for the first time. The log-transformed bioaccumulation factors (BCFs) of PCDEs in S. obliquus, D. magna, and D. rerio were in the range of 2.94-3.77, 3.29-4.03, and 2.42-2.89 L/kg w.w., respectively, indicating the species-specific bioaccumulation of PCDE congeners. The BCF values increased significantly with the increasing number of substituted Cl atoms, with the exception of CDE 209. The number of Cl atoms at the para and meta positions were found to be the major positive contributing factors for BCFs in the case of the same number of substituted Cl. The lipid-normalized biomagnification factors (BMFs) of S. obliquus to D. magna, D. magna to D. rerio, and the whole food chain for the 12 PCDE congeners ranged at 1.08-2.27, 0.81-1.64, and 0.88-3.64, respectively, suggesting that some congeners had BMFs comparable to PBDEs and PCBs. Dechlorination was the only metabolic pathway observed for S. obliquus and D. magna. For D. rerio, dechlorination, methoxylation, and hydroxylation metabolic pathways were observed. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments and theoretical calculations confirmed that methoxylation and hydroxylation occurred at the ortho position of the benzene rings. In addition, reliable quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models were constructed to qualitatively describe the relationships between molecular structure descriptors and BCFs for PCDEs. These findings provide insights into the movement and transformation of PCDEs in aquatic ecosystems."

The formation of Co(IV) in the Co3O4/ chlorite process was demonstrated through phenylmethyl sulfoxide (PMSO) probe and 18O-isotope-labeling tests. Both experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that chlorite activation involved oxygen atom transfer (OAT) during Co(IV) formation and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) in the Co(IV)-mediated ClO2 generation. Protons not only promoted the generation of Co(IV) and ClO2 by lowering the energy barrier but also strengthened the resistance of the Co3O4/chlorite process to coexisting anions, which we termed a proton enhancement effect. Although both Co(IV) and ClO2 exhibited direct oxidation of contaminants, their contributions varied with pH changes. When pH increased from 3 to 5, the deprotonation of contaminants facilitated the electrophilic attack of ClO2, while as pH increased from 5 to 8, Co(IV) gradually became the main contributor to contaminant degradation owing to its higher stability than ClO2. Moreover, ClO2- was transformed into nontoxic Cl- rather than ClO3- after the reaction, thus greatly reducing possible environmental risks. This work described a Co(IV)-involved chlorite activation process for efficient removal of organic contaminants, and a proton enhancement mechanism was revealed."

Assessments typically focus only on ingestion and inhalation exposure due to a lack of generally accepted approaches for estimating dermal absorption. Prior work indicates limited dermal absorption of ionic PFAS, but absorption of neutral PFAS has not been examined from the liquid vehicle or from vapor. Partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds from the gas phase to the skin surface (i.e., stratum corneum) is well known, but the potential for partitioning of neutral PFAS from the gas phase to the stratum corneum has yet to be estimated. The SPARC-estimated physicochemical properties were used to calculate transdermal permeability coefficients (kp_g) and dermal-to-inhalation (D/I) exposure ratios for two groups of neutral PFAS, including those on a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency PFAS list. 11 neutral PFAS gave calculated D/I ratios >5, indicating that direct transdermal absorption may be an important exposure pathway compared to inhalation. Data on consumer products or indoor air is needed for the 11 neutral PFAS, followed by possible biomonitoring to experimentally verify dermal absorption from air. Additional PFAS should be estimated by the protocol used here as they are identified in commercial products."

However, it remains a critical challenge to selectively separate and concentrate REEs from low-grade waste streams. In this study, we developed a new type of biosorbent by immobilizing Lanmodulin-SpyCatcher (LanMSpycatcher) on the surface of SpyTag-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for selective separation and recovery of REEs from waste streams. The biosorbent, referred to as MNPLanM, had an adsorption activity of 6.01 +/- 0.11 mu mol-terbium/g-sorbent and fast adsorption kinetics. The adsorbed REEs could be desorbed with >90% efficiency. The MNP-LanM selectively adsorbed REEs in the presence of a broad range of non-REEs. The protein storage stability of the MNP-LanM increased by two-fold compared to free LanM-SpyCatcher. The MNP-LanM could be efficiently separated using a magnet and reused with high stability as it retained similar to 95% of the initial activity after eight adsorption-desorption cycles. Furthermore, the MNP-LanM selectively adsorbed and concentrated REEs from the leachate of coal fly ash and geothermal brine, resulting in 967-fold increase of REE purity. This study provides a scientific basis for developing innovative biosorptive materials for selective and efficient separation and recovery of REEs from low-grade feedstocks."

In this perspective, we describe the adverse effects of MNPs particles on pollinator and plant health and discuss the mechanisms by which MNPs disrupt the pollination process. We discuss the evidence and integrate transcriptome studies to investigate the negative effects of MNPs on the molecular biology of pollination, which may cause delay or inhibit the pollination services. We conclude by addressing challenges to plant-pollinator health from MNPs pollution and argue that such harmful effects disrupt the communication between plant and pollinator for a successful pollination process."

However, limited understanding of its toxicokinetics (TK) has obstructed the necessary risk assessment. Here, we constructed the first middle out physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model to mechanistically explain the persistence of PFOA in humans. In vitro transporter kinetics were thoroughly characterized and scaled up to in vivo clearances using quantitative proteomics-based in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation. These data and physicochemical parameters of PFOA were used to parameterize our model. We uncovered a novel uptake transporter for PFOA, highly likely to be monocarboxylate transporter 1 which is ubiquitously expressed in body tissues and may mediate broad tissue penetration. Our model was able to recapitulate clinical data from a phase I dose escalation trial and divergent half-lives from clinical trial and biomonitoring studies. Simulations and sensitivity analyses confirmed the importance of renal transporters in driving extensive PFOA reabsorption, reducing its clearance and augmenting its t1/2. Crucially, the inclusion of a hypothetical, saturable renal basolateral efflux transporter provided the first unified explanation for the divergent t1/2 of PFOA reported in clinical (116 days) versus biomonitoring studies (1.3-3.9 years). Efforts are underway to build PBTK models for other perfluoroalkyl substances using similar workflows to assess their TK profiles and facilitate risk assessments."

Elevated mercury (Hg) exposure in Arctic animals could affect behavioral responses to changes in foraging landscapes caused by climate change, generating interactive effects on behavior and population resilience. We investigated this hypothesis in little auks (Alle alle), a keystone Arctic seabird. We compiled behavioral data for 44 birds across 5 years using accelerometers while also quantifying blood Hg and environmental conditions. Warm sea surface temperature (SST) and low sea ice coverage reshaped time activity budgets (TABs) and diving patterns, causing decreased resting, increased flight, and longer dives. Mercury contamination was not associated with TABs. However, highly contaminated birds lengthened interdive breaks when making long dives, suggesting Hg-induced physiological limitations.

Existing probability estimates of groundwater Mn concentrations, population estimates, and sociodemographic data were integrated with spatial data delineating domestic well communities (DWCs) to predict the probability of high Mn concentrations in extracted groundwater within DWCs in California's Central Valley. Additional Mn concentration data of water delivered by community water systems (CWSs) were used to estimate Mn in public water supply. We estimate that 0.4% of the DWC population (2342 users) rely on groundwater with predicted Mn > 300 mu g L-1. In CWSs, 2.4% of the population (904 users) served by small CWSs and 0.4% of the population (3072 users) served by medium CWS relied on drinking water with mean point-of-entry Mn concentration >300 mu g L-1. Small CWSs were less likely to report Mn concentrations relative to large CWSs, yet a higher percentage of small CWSs exceed regulatory standards relative to larger systems. Modeled calculations do not reveal differences in estimated Mn concentration between groundwater from current regional domestic well depth and 33 m deeper. These analyses demonstrate the need for additional well-monitoring programs that evaluate Mn and increased access to point-of-use treatment for domestic well users disproportionately burdened by associated costs of water treatment."

Loss of HuNoV infectivity in surface water was compared with persistence of intact HuNoV capsids and genome segments. Surface water from a freshwater creek was filter-sterilized, inoculated with HuNoV (GII.4) purified from stool, and incubated at 15 or 20 degrees C. We measured HuNoV infectivity via the human intestinal enteroid system and HuNoV persistence via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays without (genome segment persistence) or with (intact viral capsid persistence) enzymatic pretreatment to digest naked RNA. For infectious HuNoV, results ranged from no significant decay to a decay rate constant (k) of 2.2 day-1. In one creek water sample, genome damage was likely a dominant inactivation mechanism. In other samples from the same creek, loss of HuNoV infectivity could not be attributed to genome damage or capsid cleavage. The range in k and the difference in the inactivation mechanism observed in water from the same site could not be explained, but variable constituents in the environmental matrix could have contributed. Thus, a single k may be insufficient for modeling virus inactivation in surface waters."

In this study, we quantified the triple oxygen isotopic compositions (Delta iota 17O) of DIP relative to VSMOW with the reference line with a slope of 0.528 as an additional tracer to clarify the sources and dynamics of DIP in the hydrosphere. We found significant variation in the Delta iota 17O values of riverine DIP in urban areas, ranging from -107 X 10-6 to +3 X 10-6, while those of DIP in the effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and DIP extracted from the chemical fertilizers showed -56 +/- 5 X 10-6 (1SD) and -98 +/- 5 X 10-6, respectively. We conclude that both the DIP supplied directly from the artificial loads (the WWTP effluent and chemical fertilizers) showing 17O-depleted Delta iota 17O values and the DIP turned over via the aquatic biosphere showing 17O-enriched Delta iota 17O values similar to ambient H2O were the major sources of riverine DIP.

Herein, after simulated and natural solar irradiation, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and poly(vinyl chloride) nanoplastics (PVC NPs) were observed to exhibit enhanced fluorescence, particularly PVC NPs. Furthermore, the role of photoaged NPs as a potential fluorescence indicator was evaluated by exposing a model aquatic organism Daphnia magna to these NPs. Our results revealed that photoaged NPs exhibited strong fluorescence owing to the generation of conjugated pi bonds, which can achieve pi-pi* electron transition with low energy consumption. Photogenerated fluorescence also enabled the photoaged NPs to act as efficient fluorescent tracers, which can help track NP migration in various organisms. The results of two-photon laser confocal scanning microscopy revealed that the photoaged NPs could translocate across biological barriers and accumulate in extraintestinal tissues in addition to being ingested and excreted. Moreover, compared with pristine NPs, the photoaged NPs underwent biodegradation more easily, probably because of increased hydrophilicity due to photogenerated oxygen-containing moieties. Therefore, in addition to producing fluorescent NPs without the attachment of external fluorescent dyes, the natural photoaging process can promote the migration and degradation of photoaged NPs in food chains."

A challenge with studying complex eukaryotic communities is that metagenomic analysis workflows are currently not as mature as those that focus on prokaryotes or viruses. In this study, we benchmarked different strategies to recover eukaryotic sequences and genomes from metagenomic data and applied the best -performing workflow to explore the factors affecting the relative abundance and diversity of eukaryotic communities in drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs). We developed an ensemble approach exploiting k-mer-and reference-based strategies to improve eukaryotic sequence identification and identified Meta-BAT2 as the best-performing binning approach for their clustering. Applying this workflow to the DWDS metagenomes showed that eukaryotic sequences typically constituted small proportions (i.e., <1%) of the overall metagenomic data with higher relative abundances in surface water-fed or chlorinated systems with high residuals. The alpha and beta diversities of eukaryotes were correlated with those of prokaryotic and viral communities, highlighting the common role of environmental/management factors. Finally, a co -occurrence analysis highlighted clusters of eukaryotes whose members' presence and abundance in DWDSs were affected by disinfection strategies, climate conditions, and source water types."

Currently, bioconcentration is generally ignored during the identification of key EDCs. Thus, a method-ology for effect-based identification of bioconcentratable EDCs was established in Microcosm, validated in the field, and applied to typical surface water in Taihu Lake. In Microcosm, an inverted U-shaped relationship between logBCFs and logKows was observed for typical EDCs, with medium hydrophobic EDCs (3 <= logKow <= 7) exhibiting the greatest bioconcentration potentials. On this basis, enrichment methods for bioconcentratable EDCs were established using POM and LDPE, which better fitted the bioconcentration characteristics and enabled the enrichment of 71 +/- 8% and 69 +/- 6% bioconcentratable compounds. The enrichment methods were validated in the field, where LDPE exhibited a more significant correlation with the bioconcentration characteristics than POM, with mean correlation coefficients of 0.36 and 0.15, respectively, which was selected for further application. By application of the new methodology in Taihu Lake, 7 EDCs were prioritized from 79 identified EDCs as key bioconcentratable EDCs on consideration of their great abundance, bioconcentration potentials, and anti-androgenic potencies. The established methodology could support the evaluation and identification of bioconcentratable contaminants."

In this work, we investigate whether the cation/ cation selectivity of a composite cation-exchange membrane (CEM), or a thin polymer selective layer on top of a CEM, may be limited by the mass transfer resistance of the underlying CEM. In our analysis, we utilize a layer-by-layer technique to modify CEMs with a thin polymer selective layer (similar to 50 nm) that has previously shown high selectivity toward copper over similarly sized metals. While these composite membranes have a CuCl2/MgCl2 selectivity up to 33 times larger than unmodified CEMs in diffusion dialysis, our estimates suggest that eliminating resistance from the underlying CEM could further increase selectivity twofold. In contrast, the CEM base layer has a smaller effect on the selectivity of these composite membranes in electrodialysis, although these effects could become more pronounced for ultrathin or highly conductive selective layers. Our results highlight that base layer resistance prevents selectivity factors from being comparable across diffusion dialysis and electrodialysis, and CEMs with low resistance are necessary for providing highly precise separations with composite CEMs."	"[DuChanois, Ryan M.; Mazurowski, Lauren; Fan, Hanqing; Elimelech, Menachem] Yale Univ, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [DuChanois, Ryan M.; Mazurowski, Lauren; Verduzco, Rafael; Elimelech, Menachem] Nanosyst Engn Res Ctr Nanotechnol Enabled Water Tr, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Verduzco, Rafael] Rice Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Mat Sci & NanoEngn, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Nir, Oded] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Zuckerberg Inst Water Res, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Dept Desalinat & Water Treatment, IL-8499000 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel"	"Yale University; Rice University; Ben Gurion University"	"Elimelech, M (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;Elimelech, M (corresponding author), Nanosyst Engn Res Ctr Nanotechnol Enabled Water Tr, Houston, TX 77005 USA."

Much of the AFFF is manufactured using electrochemical fluorination by 3M. Precursors with six perfluorinated carbons (C6) and non-fluorinated amine substituents make up approximately one-third of the PFAS in 3M AFFF. C6 precursors can be transformed through nitrification (microbial oxidation) of amine moieties into perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), a compound of regulatory concern. Here, we report biotransformation of the most abundant C6 sulfonamido precursors in 3M AFFF with available commercial standards (FHxSA, PFHxSAm, and PFHxSAmS) in microcosms representative of the groundwater/surface water boundary. Results show rapid (<1 day) biosorption to living cells by precursors but slow biotransformation into PFHxS (1-100 pM day-1). The transformation pathway includes one or two nitrification steps and is supported by the detection of key intermediates using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Increasing nitrate concentrations and total abundance of nitrifying taxa occur in parallel with precursor biotransformation. Together, these data provide multiple lines of evidence supporting microbially limited biotransformation of C6 sulfonamido precursors involving ammonia-oxidizing archaea (Nitrososphaeria) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospina). Further elucidation of interrelationships between precursor biotransformation and nitrogen cycling in ecosystems would help inform site remediation efforts."

Prior studies have primarily focused on the control of agricultural NH3 emissions, the dominant source of anthropogenic NH3 emissions. The air quality impact from vehicular NH3 emissions, which could be particularly important in urban areas, has not been adequately evaluated. We developed high-resolution vehicular NH3 emission inventories for Beijing and Shanghai based on detailed link-level traffic profiles and conducted atmospheric simulations of ambient PM2.5 concentrations contributed by vehicular NH3 emissions. We found that vehicular NH3 emissions shared high proportions among total anthropogenic NH3 emissions in the urban areas of Beijing (86%) and Shanghai (45%), where vehicular NH3 was primarily emitted by gasoline vehicles. Local vehicular NH3 emissions could be responsible for approximately 3% of urban PM2.5 concentrations during wintertime, and the contributions could be much higher during polluted periods (similar to 3 mu g m-3). We also showed that controlling vehicular NH3 emissions will be effective and feasible to alleviate urban PM2.5 pollution for megacities in the near future."

Therefore, characterizing the long-term environmental behavior of trace metals and their driving forces is essential for guiding water quality management. Based on a long-term data set from 1990 to 2019, this study systematically conducted the spatiotemporal trend assessment, influential factor analysis, and source apportionment of trace elements in the rivers of the German Elbe River basin. Results show that the mean concentrations of the given elements in the last 30 years were found in the order of Fe (1179.5 +/- 1221 mu g-L-1) >> Mn (209.6 +/- 181.7 mu g-L-1) >> Zn (52.5 +/- 166.2 mu g-L-1) >> Cu (5.3 +/- 5.5 mu g-L-1) > Ni (4.4 +/- 8.3 mu g-L-1) > Pb (3.3 +/- 4.4 mu g-L-1) > As (2.9 +/- 2.3 mu g-L-1) > Cr (1.8 +/- 2.4 mu g-L-1) >> Cd (0.3 +/- 1.1 mu g-L-1) > Hg (0.05 +/- 0.12 mu g-L-1). Wavelet analyses show that river flow regimes and flooding dominated the periodic variations in metal pollution. Bayesian network suggests that the hydrochemical factors (i.e., TOC, TP, TN, pH, and EC) chemically influenced the metal mobility between water and sediments. Furthermore, the source apportionment computed by the Bayesian multivariate receptor model shows that the given element contamination was typically attributed to the geogenic sources (17.5, 95% confidence interval: 13.1-17.6%), urban and industrial sources (22.1, 18.0-27.2%), arable soil erosion (24.2, 16.4-31.5%), and historical anthropogenic activities (35.2, 32.8-43.3%). The results provided herein reveal that both the hydrochemical influence on metal mobility and the chronic disturbance from anthropogenic activities caused the long-term variation in trace metal pollution."

However, significant uncertainties remain in the source apportionment due to a lack of source-specific evaluation of Fe-laden aerosols. Here, the large uncertainties in the model estimates are investigated using different Fe emissions from metal production. The best agreement in the anthropogenic factor of aerosol Fe concentrations with the field data in the downstream region of East Asian outflow (median: 0.026 mu g m-3) is obtained with the low case (0.023 mu g m-3), whereas the best agreement of aerosol Fe bioaccessibility with field data (4.5%) over oceans south of 45 degrees S is obtained with the high case (4.9%). Our simulation with the low case confirms that anthropogenic aerosols play dominant roles in bioaccessible Fe deposition in the northwestern Pacific, compared to lithogenic sources. Our simulations with higher cases suggest that Fe-containing particles co emitted with sulfur dioxide from metal production substantially contribute to atmospheric bioaccessible Fe fluxes to the Southern Ocean. These findings highlight that accurate representation of aerosol Fe from metal production is a key to reduce large uncertainties in bioaccessible Fe deposition fluxes to the Southern Ocean (0.7-4.4 Gg Fe year-1)."

A novel Bayesian inference (BI) approach is proposed to achieve such quantification using only major component measurement data and tested in two case studies. One case study composes of filter-based daily compositional data made in the Pearl River Delta region, China, during 2012, while the other uses online measurement data recorded at the Dianshan Lake monitoring site in Shanghai in wintertime 2019. Source-specific organic trace measurement data are available in both the cases so that positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis is performed, where PMFresolved POC and SOC are used as the best available reference values for model evaluation. Meanwhile, traditional techniques, i.e., minimum ratio value, minimum R squared, and multiple linear regression, are also employed and evaluated. For both the cases, the BI models have shown significant advantages in accurately estimating POC and SOC amounts over conventional methods. Further analysis suggests that using sulfate as the SOC tracer in BI model gives the best model performance. This methodological advance provides an improved and practical tool to derive POC and SOC levels for addressing PM-related environmental impacts."

RNA sequencing and advanced bioinformatics analyses predicted and characterized the key biological processes and pathways affected by PFNA exposure, which included the synaptogenesis signaling pathway, neurotransmitter synapse, and CREB signaling in neurons. Neurotransmitter levels (acetylcholine, glutamate, 5-hydroxytryptamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, dopamine, and noradrenaline) were significantly decreased in zebrafish larvae, and the Tg(gad67:GFP) transgenic line revealed a decreased number of GABAergic neurons in PFNA-treated larvae.

Here, we report biotransformation of the most abundant C6 sulfonamido precursors in 3M AFFF with available commercial standards (FHxSA, PFHxSAm, and PFHxSAmS) in microcosms representative of the groundwater/surface water boundary. Results show rapid (<1 day) biosorption to living cells by precursors but slow biotransformation into PFHxS (1-100 pM day(-1)). The transformation pathway includes one or two nitrification steps and is supported by the detection of key intermediates using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Increasing nitrate concentrations and total abundance of nitrifying taxa occur in parallel with precursor biotransformation. Together, these data provide multiple lines of evidence supporting microbially limited biotransformation of C6 sulfonamido precursors involving ammonia-oxidizing archaea (Nitrososphaeria) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospina). Further elucidation of interrelationships between precursor biotransformation and nitrogen cycling in ecosystems would help inform site remediation efforts."

This study was the first to examine the tissue-specific disposition of aqueous 226Ra in a coastal mussel, specifically the Atlantic ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa. Most organ groups reached steady-state concentrations within 7 days during experimental exposure, with an average uptake rate constant of 0.0013 mL g-1 d-1. When moved to Ra-free synthetic seawater, mussels rapidly eliminated aqueous 226Ra (average elimination rate constant 1.56 d-1). The biological half-life for aqueous 226Ra ranged from 8.9 h for the gills and labial palps to 15.4 h for the muscle. Although previous field studies have demonstrated notable 226Ra accumulation in the soft tissues of marine mussels and that, for freshwater mussels, tissue-incorporated 226Ra derives primarily from the aqueous phase, our tissue-specific bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were on the order of (8.3 +/- 1.5) x 10-4 indicating low accumulation potential of aqueous 226Ra in estuarine mussels. This suggests marine and estuarine mussels obtain 226Ra from an alternate route, such as particulate-sorbed Ra ingested during filter-feeding or from a contaminated food source."

Foam mats are a potential source of formamide and ammonia. Online dopant-assisted atmospheric pressure photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DA-APPI-TOFMS) coupled with a Teflon environmental chamber was developed to assess the exposure risk of formamide and ammonia from foam mats to children. High levels of formamide (average 3363.72 mg/m3) and ammonia (average 1586.78 mg/m3) emissions were measured from 21 foam mats with three different raw material types: ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA: n = 7), polyethylene (PE: n = 7), and cross-linked polyethylene (XPE: n = 7). The 28 day emission testing for the selected PE mat showed that the emissions of formamide were 2 orders of magnitude higher than the EU emission limit of 20 mu g/m3, and formamide may be a permanent indoor contaminant for foam mat products during their life cycle. The exposure assessment of children aged 0.5-6 years showed that the exposure dose was approximately hundreds of mg/kg-day, and the age group of 0.5-2 years was subject to much higher dermal exposures than others. Thus, this study provided key relevant information for further studies on assessing children's exposure to indoor air pollution from foam mats."

Several approaches have been proposed for mitigation of N2O emissions from WWTPs and have shown promising yet only site-specific results. Here, self-sustaining biotrickling filtration, an end-of-the-pipe treatment technology, was tested in situ at a full-scale WWTP under realistic operational conditions. Temporally varying untreated wastewater was used as trickling medium, and no temperature control was applied. The off-gas from the covered WWTP aerated section was conveyed through the pilot-scale reactor, and an average removal efficiency of 57.9 +/- 29.1% was achieved during 165 days of operation despite the generally low and largely fluctuating influent N2O concentrations (ranging between 4.8 and 96.4 ppmv). For the following 60-day period, the continuously operated reactor system removed 43.0 +/- 21.2% of the periodically augmented N2O, exhibiting elimination capacities as high as 5.25 g N2O m-3 center dot h-1. Additionally, the bench-scale experiments performed abreast corroborated the resilience of the system to short-term N2O starvations. Our results corroborate the feasibility of biotrickling filtration for mitigating N2O emitted from WWTPs and demonstrate its robustness toward suboptimal field operating conditions and N2O starvation, as also supported by analyses of the microbial compositions and nosZ gene profiles."

Despite its importance outdoors, there have been relatively few measurements of the OH radical in indoor environments. During the House Observations of Microbial and Environmental Chemistry (HOME-Chem) campaign, elevated concentrations of OH were observed near a window during cooking events, in addition to elevated mixing ratios of nitrous acid (HONO), VOCs, and nitrogen oxides (NOX). Particularly high concentrations were measured during the preparation of a traditional American Thanksgiving dinner, which required the use of a gas stove and oven almost continually for 6 h. A zero-dimensional chemical model underpredicted the measured OH concentrations even during periods when direct sunlight illuminated the area near the window, which increases the rate of OH production by photolysis of HONO. Interferences with measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) suggest that unmeasured photolytic VOCs were emitted during cooking events. The addition of a VOC that photolyzes to produce peroxy radicals (RO2), similar to pyruvic acid, into the model results in better agreement with the OH measurements. These results highlight our incomplete understanding of the nature of oxidation in indoor environments."

A range of state-level interventions have also been enacted, but their implications for the financial viability of biorefineries are not well understood. To address this gap, this study evaluated the efficacy of 20 state-level tax incentives from 14 states and their interactions with other location-specific economic parameters (e.g., state income tax rates, electricity prices). To characterize implications of location-specific policies and parameters on biorefinery cash flows, we developed a new BioSTEAM Location-Specific Evaluation (BLocS) module for the open-source software BioSTEAM. Leveraging BLocS and BioSTEAM, we characterized the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) for a cellulosic biorefinery (using corn stover as feedstock) and two conventional biorefineries (using corn or sugarcane as feedstock) for comparison.

This study aimed to explore the effect of various MP properties and environmental characteristics on the entrainment and enrichment of MPs in ice under varying turbulence conditions. It was found that high rotation speed in freshwater distinctively enhanced the entrainment of hydrophobic MPs in ice, this being attributable to the combined effects of frazil ice and air bubbles. The hydrophobic nature of these MPs caused them to be attracted to the water/air or water/ice interface. However, in saline water, high turbulence inhibited the entrainment of all of the MP types under study. The ice crystals formed a loose structure in saline water instead of congealing, and this allowed the exchange of MPs between ice and water, leading to the rapid expulsion of MPs from the ice. The enrichment factors of all the MPs under study increased in calm saline water compared to in calm freshwater. The results revealed that the entrainment and enrichment of MPs in ice can be critical pathways affecting their fate in cold regions."

However, a fundamental understanding of the complex mixing states is still lacking because most traditional analysis techniques only reveal bulk chemical and physical properties with limited surface and 3-D information. In this research, 3-D molecular imaging enabled by ToF-SIMS was used to elucidate the mixing states of PM2.5 samples obtained from a typical Beijing winter haze event. In light pollution cases, a thin organic layer covers separated inorganic particles; while in serious pollution cases, ion exchange and an organic-inorganic mixing surface on large-area particles were observed. The new results provide key 3-D molecular information of mixing states, which is highly potential for reducing uncertainty and bias in representing aerosol-cloud interactions in current Earth System Models and improving the understanding of aerosols on air quality and human health."

Observations show that marine background aerosols from the Gulf of Mexico were highly processed and acidic; sulfate was the most abundant component (on average 57% of total PM1 mass), followed by organic material (26%). These chemical characteristics are similar to those observed at other marine locations globally. However, Gulf background aerosols were much more polluted; the average non-refractory (NR-) PM1 mass concentration was 3-70 times higher than that observed in other clean marine atmospheres. Anthropogenic shipping emissions over the Gulf of Mexico explain 78.3% of the total measured background sulfate in the Gulf air. We frequently observed haze pollution in the air mass from the Gulf, with significantly elevated concentrations of sulfate, organosulfates, and secondary organic aerosol associated with sulfuric acid. Analysis suggests that aqueous oxidation of shipping emissions over the Gulf of Mexico by peroxides in the particles might potentially be an important pathway for the rapid production of acidic sulfate and organosulfates during the haze episodes under acidic conditions."

Membrane foulants present large hydrophobic fractions, with humic acid (HA) being a prevalent example of hydrophobic natural organic matter. Furthermore, HA contains numerous aromatic rings (E electrons), and its hydrophobic interactions are a major cause of irreversible membrane fouling. To address this issue, in this study, we used the cation-E interaction, which is a strong noncovalent, competitive interaction present in water. Because the strength of cation-E interactions depends on the combination of cations and E molecules, utilizing the appropriate cations will effectively remove irreversible fouling caused by hydrophobic HA. We performed macroscale experiments to determine the cleaning potential of the test cations, nanomechanically analyzed the changes in HA cohesion caused by the test cations using a surface force apparatus and an atomic force microscope, and used molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the HA removal mechanism of test studied cations. We found that the addition of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium, an imidazolium cation with an aromatic moiety, effectively removed the HA layer by weakening its cohesion, and the size, hydrophobicity, and polarity of the HA layer synergistically affected the HA removal mechanism based on the cation-E interactions."

The most common management option for biosolids is to beneficially reuse them as an agricultural amendment, but because of the risk of pathogen exposure, many regulatory bodies require pathogen reduction before biosolids reuse. Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are well documented in biosolids, but limited information is available on how biosolids treatment processes impact PFAS. Furthermore, quantification of PFAS has focused on perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) which are a small fraction of thousands of PFAS known to exist. The objective of this study was to quantify 92 PFAS in biosolids collected from eight biosolids treatment facilities before and after four pathogen treatment applications: composting, heat treatment, lime treatment, and anaerobic digestion. Overall, total PFAS concentrations before and after treatment were dominated by PFAA precursor species, in particular, diPAPs which accounted for a majority of the mass of the sigma 92PFAS. This differs from historic data that found PFAAs, primarily PFOS, to dominate total PFAS concentrations. Treatment options such as heat treatment and composting changed the ratio of PFAA precursors to PFAAs indicating a transformation of PFAS during treatment. This study finds that PFAA precursors are likely underrepresented by other studies and make up a larger percentage of the total PFAS concentration in biosolids than previously estimated."

The tailored deep eutectic solvent (DES) choline chloride-formic acid (ChCl-FA) demonstrated a high selectivity and efficiency in extracting critical metals from mixed cathode materials (LiFePO4:Li(NiCoMn)1/3O2 mass ratio of 1:1) under mild conditions (80 degrees C, 120 min) with a solid-liquid mass ratio of 1:200. The leaching performance of critical metals could be further enhanced by mechanochemical processing because of particle size reduction, grain refinement, and internal energy storage. Furthermore, mechanochemical reactions effectively inhibited undesirable leaching of nontarget elements (iron and phosphorus), thus promoting the selectivity and leaching efficiency of critical metals. This was achieved through the preoxidation of Fe and the enhanced stability of iron phosphate framework, which significantly increased the separation factor of critical metals to nontarget elements from 56.9 to 1475. The proposed combination of ChCl-FA extraction and the mechanochemical reaction can achieve a highly selective extraction of critical metals from multisource spent LIBs under mild conditions."

Herein, this study developed two in situ spectroscopic methods to systematically explore the effect of air humidity on MP photoaging using a microscope of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and a laser Raman microscope, which were equipped with a humidity control system. Polyethylene microplastics, polystyrene microplastics, and poly(vinyl chloride) microplastics (PVC-MPs) were used as model MPs. Our results showed that relative humidity (RH) could significantly influence the MP surface oxygen-containing moieties generated from photo-oxidation, especially for PVC-MPs. As the RH level varied from 10 to 90%, a decrease in the photogenerated carbonyl group and an increase in the hydroxyl group were observed. This could be attributed to the involvement of water molecules in the production of hydroxyl groups, which subsequently inhibited carbonyl generation. Moreover, the adsorption of coexisting contaminants (i.e., tetracycline) on photoaged MPs exhibited strong RH dependence, which could be assigned to the varied hydrogen bonding between tetracycline carbonyls and aged MP surface hydroxyls. This study reveals a ubiquitous but previously overlooked MP aging route, which may account for the changed MP surface physiochemical properties under solar irradiation."

Herein, susceptible Escherichia coli K12 was continuously exposed to five antibiotics at such concentrations for 100 days. The de novo-evolved mutants rapidly obtained fluoroquinolone resistance within 10 days, as indicated by the 4 -and 16-fold augmentation of minimum inhibitory concentrations against enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Moreover, the mutants maintained heritable fluoroquinolone resistance after the withdrawal of antibiotics for 30 days. Genomic analysis identified Asp87Gly or Ser83Leu substitutions in the gyrA gene in the mutants. Transcriptomics data showed that the transcriptional response of the mutants to fluoroquino-lones was primarily involved in biofilm formation, cellular motility, porin, oxidative stress defense, and energy metabolism. Homologous recombination and molecular docking revealed that mutations of gyrA primarily mainly conferred fluoroquinolone resistance, while mutations at different positions of gyrA likely endowed different fluoroquinolone resistance levels. Collectively, this study revealed that environmentally relevant concentrations of antibiotics could rapidly induce heritable antibiotic resistance; therefore, the discharge of antibiotics into the environment should be rigorously controlled to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance."

However, whether the knowledge attained by ML with a limited number of available data is enough to capture and validate the fundamental principles of membrane science remains elusive. Herein, we applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to thoroughly investigate the knowledge learned by ML on the mechanisms of ion transport across polyamide reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes by leveraging 1,585 data from 26 membrane types. The Shapley additive explanation method based on cooperative game theory was used to unveil the influences of various ion and membrane properties on the model predictions. XAI shows that the ML can capture the important roles of size exclusion and electrostatic interaction in regulating membrane separation properly. XAI also identifies that the mechanisms governing ion transport possess different relative importance to cation and anion rejections during RO and NF filtration. Overall, we provide a framework to evaluate the knowledge underlying the ML model prediction and demonstrate that ML is able to learn fundamental mechanisms of ion transport across polyamide membranes, highlighting the importance of elucidating model interpretability for more reliable and explainable ML applications to membrane selection and design."

An AFFF with 34 major PFAS (12 anions and 22 zwitterions) was added to uncontaminated soil in one-dimensional saturated column experiments and PFAS mass retained was measured. PFAS mass retention was described using an exhaustive statistical approach to generate a poly-parameter quantitative structure-property relation-ship (ppQSPR). The relevant predictive properties were PFAS molar mass, mass fluorine, number of nitrogens in the PFAS molecule, poorly crystalline Fe oxides, organic carbon, and specific (BET-N2) surface area. The retention of anionic PFAS was nearly independent of soil properties and largely a function of molecular hydrophobicity, with the size of the fluorinated side chain as the main predictor. Retention of nitrogen-containing zwitterionic PFAS was related to poorly crystalline metal oxides and organic carbon content. Knowledge of the extent to which a suite of PFAS may respond to variations in soil matrix properties, as developed here, paves the way for the development of reactive transport algorithms with the ability to capture PFAS dynamics in source zones over extended time frames."

Here, we conducted a longer-term field monitoring campaign using low-cost sensors and evaluated interand intra-household PM2.5 variations in rural areas where energy or stove stacking is common. Household PM2.5 varied largely across different homes but also within households. Using generalized linear models and dominance analysis, we estimated that outdoor PM2.5 explained 19% of the intrahousehold variation in indoor daily PM2.5, whereas factors like the outdoor temperature and indoor-outdoor temperature difference that was associated with energy use directly or indirectly, explained 26% of the temporal variation. Inter-household variation was lower than intrahousehold variation. The inter-household variation was strongly associated with distinct internal sources, with energy-use-associated factors explaining 35% of the variation. The statistical source apportionment model estimated that solid fuel burning for heating contributed an average of 31%-55% of PM2.5 annually, whereas the contribution of sources originating from the outdoors was & LE;10%. By replacing raw biomass or coal with biomass pellets in gasifier burners for heating, indoor PM2.5 could be significantly reduced and indoor temperature substantially increased, providing thermal comforts in addition to improved air quality."

The actual CH4 emissions at the plant-or regional level vary greatly due to site-specific conditions as well as high seasonal and diurnal variations. Here, we conducted the first quantitative analysis of CH4 emissions from different types of sewers and water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs). We examined variations in CH4 emissions associated with methods applied in different monitoring campaigns, and identified main CH4 sources and sinks to facilitate carbon emission reduction efforts in the wastewater sector. We found plant-wide CH4 emissions vary by orders of magnitude, from 0.01 to 110 g CH4/m3 with high emissions associated with plants equipped with anaerobic digestion or stabilization ponds. Rising mains show higher dissolved CH4 concentrations than gravity sewers when transporting similar raw sewage under similar environmental conditions, but the latter dominates most collection systems around the world. Using the updated data sets, we estimated annual CH4 emission from the U.S. centralized, municipal wastewater treatment to be approximately 10.9 +/- 7.0 MMT CO2-eq/year, which is about twice as the IPCC (2019) Tier 2 estimates (4.3-6.1 MMT CO2-eq/year). Given CH4 emission control will play a crucial role in achieving net zero carbon goals by the midcentury, more studies are needed to profile and mitigate CH4 emissions from the wastewater sector."

A straightforward strategy is to reduce slurry retention time inside pig houses by frequent transfer to outside storages, where temperature and therefore microbial activity are lower. We demonstrate three frequent slurry removal strategies in pig houses in a year-round continuous measurement campaign. Slurry funnels, slurry trays, and weekly flushing reduced slurry methane emission by 89, 81, and 53%, respectively. Slurry funnels and slurry trays reduced ammonia emission by 25-30%. An extended version of the anaerobic biodegradation model (ABM) was fitted and validated using barn measurements. It was then applied for predicting storage emission and shows that there is a risk of negating barn methane reductions due to increased emission from outside storage. Therefore, we recommend combining the removal strategies with anaerobic digestion pre-storage or storage mitigation technologies such as slurry acidification. However, even without storage mitigation technologies, predicted net methane reduction from pig houses and following outside storage was at least 30% for all slurry removal strategies."

In this study, we explored the effects of dynamic fluctuations of capillary fringe on the transport of microplastics (MPs) in the substrate combining various environmental and MP properties. Both experimental and Hydrus-2D modeling results confirmed that increasing cycles of water table fluctuation led to the rise of capillary fringe. An increase in the cycles of water table fluctuations did not significantly change the overall MP retention percentages in 0.5 mm substrate but altered the MP distribution along the column. In 1 and 2 mm substrate, the increase in cycle numbers enhanced the MP transport from substrate to the water below. In terms of the size of the MPs, more 20-25 mu m polyethylene (PE2) were retained in the substrate compared to 4-6 mu m polyethylene (PE1) under the same number of fluctuation cycles. High-density polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, 5-6 mu m) exhibited higher retention percentages compared to PE1 particles. Ultraviolet aging for 60 days enhanced PE1 transport along the column, while 60 days of seawater aging did not affect PE1 transport greatly. For PTFE, ultraviolet and seawater aging enhanced its retention in the substrate. The retention percentages of both PE1 and PTFE in the column increased with the elevated ionic strength and the decrease of fluctuation velocity. This work highlights that capillary fringe fluctuation can serve as a pathway to relocate MPs to the tidal aquifer."

However, the oxic process is a critical unit of biological wastewater treatment for microorganisms performing organic matter removal, wherein DOS transformation and its mechanism are poorly understood. This study investigated the transformation of DOS during the oxic process in 47 full-scale municipal WWTPs across China from molecular and microbial aspects. Surprisingly, evident differences in DOS variations (Delta DOS) separated sampled WWTPs into two groups: 28 WWTPs with decreased DOS concentrations in effluents (Delta DOS < 0) and 19 WWTPs with increased DOS (Delta DOS > 0). These two groups also presented differences in DOS molecular characteristics: higher nitrogen/carbon (N/C) ratios (0.030) and more peptide-like DOS (8.2%) occurred in WWTPs with Delta DOS > 0, implying that peptide-like DOS generated from microbes contributed to increased DOS in effluents. Specific microbe-DOS correlations (Spearman correlation, p < 0.05) indicated that increased effluent DOS might be explained by peptide-like DOS preferentially being produced during copiotrophic bacterial growth and accumulating due to less active cofactor metabolisms. Considering the potential environmental issues accompanying DOS discharge from WWTPs with Delta DOS > 0, our study highlights the importance of focusing on the transformation and control of DOS in the oxic process."

These data were analyzed using a multiple linear regression model to determine spatial and temporal trends. Overall, the levels of flame retardants remain significantly higher in urban sites compared to rural and remote sites except for pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB), hexabro-mobenzene (HBB), and total Dechlorane Plus (sigma DP). Here, we report the first findings of decreasing levels of sigma DP at Sturgeon Point, New York. The atmospheric levels of total PBDEs remain unchanged over time near Lakes Michigan and Superior and declined near Lakes Erie and Ontario, with rate constants at the latter two lakes revealing halving times of approximately 7 to 14 years. This work presents results from the first investigation of PBDE source apportionment in the Great Lakes atmosphere. Source apportionment by use of positive matrix factorization (PMF) identified two legacy commercial technical mixtures (i.e., penta-BDE and deca-BDE mixes) and elucidated a factor representing ambient degradation. Our results show that weathered local sources of technical commercial mixtures, and their photolysis contribute most to the total PBDE burden in the Great Lakes atmosphere."

However, PFAS cannot be destroyed by widely used removal processes like nanofiltration (NF). A few scarcely implemented advanced oxidation processes can degrade PFAS. In this study, we apply an electric field to a membrane system by placing a nanofiltration membrane between reactive electrodes in a crossflow configuration. The performance of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) rejection, water flux, and energy consumption were evaluated. The reactive and robust SnO2-Sb porous anode was created via a sintering and sol-gel process. The characterization and analysis techniques included field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ion chromatography, mass spectroscopy, porosimeter, and pH meter. The PFOA rejection increased from 45% (0 V) to 97% (30 V) when the electric field and filtration were in the same direction, while rejection capabilities worsened in opposite directions. With saline solutions (1 mM Na2SO4) present, the induced electro-oxidation process could effectively mineralize PFOA, although this led to unstable removal and water fluxes. The design achieved an exceptional performance in the nonsaline feed of 97% PFOA rejection and water flux of 68.4 L/m2 hr while requiring only 7.31 x 10-5 kWh/m3/order of electrical energy. The approach's success is attributed to the proximity of the electrodes and membrane, which causes a stronger electric field, weakened concentration polarization, and reduced mass transfer distances of PFOA near the membrane. The proposed electric field-assisted nanofiltration design provides a practical membrane separation method for PFAS removal from water."

In this study, machine-learned Bayesian network (BN) models were used to predict building-wide water lead risk in over 4,000 child care facilities in North Carolina according to maximum and 90th percentile lead levels from water lead concentrations at 22,943 taps. The performance of the BN models was compared to common alternative risk factors, or heuristics, used to inform water lead testing programs among child care facilities including building age, water source, and Head Start program status. The BN models identified a range of variables associated with building-wide water lead, with facilities that serve low-income families, rely on groundwater, and have more taps exhibiting greater risk. Models predicting the probability of a single tap exceeding each target concentration performed better than models predicting facilities with clustered high-risk taps. The BN models' F beta-scores outperformed each of the alternative heuristics by 118-213%. This represents up to a 60% increase in the number of high-risk facilities that could be identified and up to a 49% decrease in the number of samples that would need to be collected by using BN model-informed sampling compared to using simple heuristics. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of machine-learning approaches for identifying high water lead risk that could improve lead testing programs nationwide."	"[Mulhern, Riley E.; Kondash, A.

Electrochemical activation of Fe-TAML would appear an attractive alternative to H2O2 activation, especially if the Fe-TAML complex could be attached to the anode, as this would enable formation of high valent iron species at the anode and, importantly, retention of the valuable Fe-TAML complex within the reaction system. In this work, we affix Fe-TAML to the surface of carbon black particles and apply this suspension anode process to oxidize selected target compounds via generation of high valent iron species. We show that the overpotential for Fe(IV) formation is 0.17 V lower than the potential required to generate Fe(IV) electrochemically in homogeneous solution and also show that the stability of the Fe(IV) species is enhanced considerably compared to the homogeneous Fe-TAML case. Application of the carbon black-supported Fe-TAML suspension anode reactor to degradation of oxalate and hydroquinone with an initial pH value of 3 resulted in oxidation rate constants that were up to three times higher than could be achieved by anodic oxidation in the absence of Fe-TAML and at energy consumptions per order of removal substantially lower than could be achieved by alternate technologies."

To identify the true taxon-taxon associations within thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD) microbiome and reveal the influence of carbon cloth (CC) addition, we sampled micron-scale single flocs (40-70 mu m) randomly isolated from lab-scale thermophilic digesters. Results revealed that CC addition not only significantly boosted methane yield by 25.3% but also increased the spatial heterogeneity of the community in the sludge medium. After CC addition, an evident translocation of Pseudomonas from the medium to the biofilm was observed, showing their remarkable capacity for biofilm formation. Additionally, Clostridium and Thermotogaceae tightly aggregated and steadily co-occurred in the medium and biofilm of the TAD microbiome, which might be associated with their unique extracellular sugar metabolizing style. Finally, CC induced syntrophic interaction between Syntrophomonas and denitrifiers of Rhodocyclaceae. The upregulated respiration-associated electron transferring genes (Cyst-c, complex III) on the cellular membranes of these collaborating partners indicated a potential coupling of the denitrification pathway with syntrophic acetate oxidation via direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET). These findings provide an insight into how conductive materials promote thermophilic digestion performance and open the path for improved community monitoring of biotreatment systems."

This study demonstrated that PAN was photochemically formed with a simulated production rate of 0.28 +/- 0.06 ppbv h-1 in the Nanling mountains (1690 m a.s.l.) of South China and that net PAN formation was dependent on both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NOx precursors (transition regime). In contrast to dominated acetaldehyde oxidation in previous urban and rural research, PAN at Nanling was primarily formed by methylglyoxal (38%), acetaldehyde (28%), radicals (20%), and other oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) (13%). Moreover, when polluted air masses invaded the Nanling mountains, the PAN production rate was altered, primarily because anthropogenic aromatics intensified PAN formation via the oxidized pathways of methylglyoxal, other OVOCs, and radicals. Finally, net PAN formation at Nanling reduced the hydroxyl radical level by consuming NOx, impaired local radical cycling, and thereby suppressed local O3 production. This suppressing effect was exacerbated on polluted days. The findings of this study deepen our understanding of PAN photochemistry and the impact of anthropogenic intrusions on the background atmosphere of mountainous regions."

However, the association between complex anthropogenic nitrogen pollution and bacteria has not been extensively investigated owing to the difficulties faced while determining the distribution of nitrogen contaminants in watersheds. Here, we employed the Soil and Water Assessment Tool alongside microbiological analysis to explore microbial characteristics and their responses to complex nitrogen pollution patterns. Significant variations in microbial communities were observed in sub-basins with distinct land-water pollution transport modes. Point source-dominated areas (PSDAs) exhibited reduced microbial diversity, high number of denitrification groups, and increased nitrogen cycling compared with others. The negative relative deviations (-3.38) between the measured and simulated nitrate concentrations in PSDAs indicated that nitrate removal was more effective in PSDAs. Pollution sources were also closely associated with microbiota. Eflluents from concentrated animal feeding operations were the primary factors relating to the microbiota compositions in PSDAs and balanced areas. In nonpoint source-dominated areas, contaminants from septic tanks become the most relevant sources to microbial community structures. Overall, this study expands our knowledge regarding microbial biogeochemistry in catchments and beyond by linking specific nitrogen pollution scenarios to microorganisms."

Accurate atmospheric concentrations of MP are essential for evaluating their capacity for long-range transport and for assessing human inhalation risk. In order to sample airborne MP in locations with limited power supply, we adapted a flow-through passive sampler by placing a glass fiber filter in the inner sampling tube. To test the new sampler's performance under field conditions, two sizes of the flow-through sampler (with diameters of 20 and 10 cm) and a conventionally pumped high-volume air sampler were co-deployed on the Lhasa campus of the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research. Accurate sampling volumes could be estimated from a relationship between wind speeds recorded outside and inside of the flow-through sampler. Atmospheric concentrations and compositions of MP that compared favorably with those obtained by active sampling indicate that the larger version of the flow-through passive sampler can provide reproducible and quantitative information on atmospheric MP at sites with limited or unreliable power supply. This capability should be useful in large-scale and high-temporal resolution air monitoring networks for MP."

The effects of the reaction temperature and the ozone to toluene concentration ratio on the catalyst performance were investigated. The optimized MnO2-260 catalyst prepared at the limiting hydrothermal temperature (260 degrees C) showed high catalytic activity (XTol = 95%) and excellent stability (1200 min) at the approximately ambient temperature of 40 degrees C, which was superior to the results in previous studies. The structure and morphology of (5-MnO2 were characterized by extended X-ray absorption fine structure, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, and other techniques. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations were in agreement that surface oxygen vacancy clusters, especially surface oxygen dimer vacancies, are critical in ozone activation. Oxygen vacancies can facilitate the adsorption and activation of O3 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS, including 1O2, O2-, and center dot OH), leading to superior ozonation activity to degrade toluene and intermediates. Meanwhile, free radical detection and scavenger tests indicated that center dot OH is the primary ROS during toluene ozonation rather than 1O2 or O2-."

Multidrug resistance genes are a class of ARGs, and their high prevalence in natural soil ecosystems has recently raised concerns. Since most of these genes express proton motive force (PMF) driven efflux pumps, studying whether soil pH is a determinant for the selection of multidrug efflux pump genes and thus shaping the soil resistome are of great interest. In this study, we collected 108 soils with pH values ranging from 4.37 to 9.69 from multiple ecosystems and profiled the composition of ARGs for metagenomes and metagenome-assembled genomes. We observed the multidrug efflux pump genes enriched in the acidic soil resistome, and their abundances have significant soil pH dependence. This reflects the benefits of high soil proton activity on the multidrug efflux pump genes, especially for the PMF-driven inner membrane transferase. In addition, we preliminary indicate the putative microbial participants in pH shaping the soil resistome by applying ecological analyzing tools such as stepwise regression and random forest model fitting. The decisive influence of proton activity on shaping the resistome is more impactful than any other examined factors, and as the consequence, we revisited the influence of edaphic factors on the soil resistome; i.e., the deterministic selection of resistance mechanisms by edaphic factors could lead to the bottom-up shaping of the ARG composition. Such natural developing mechanisms of the resistome are herein suggested to be considered in assessing human-driven ARG transmissions."

Limited access to safe water is projected to impact approximately 5 billion people worldwide by 2050. Climate change and worsening severe weather events pose increasing threats to global water safety. However, people may not perceive links between climate change and water safety, potentially undermining their willingness to implement behaviors that improve water safety. Existing studies on water safety risk perceptions have mostly been conducted in single-country contexts, which limits researchers' ability to make cross-national comparisons. Here, we assessed the extent to which people's severe weather concern and climate change concern predict their water safety concern. Our analyses used survey data from the 142-country 2019 Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll, including 21 low-income and 34 lower-middle-income countries. In mixed-effects models, severe weather concern was significantly more predictive of water safety concern than was climate change concern, although both resulted in positive associations. Worldwide, this finding was robust, insensitive to key model specifications and countries' varying protection against unsafe drinking water. We suggest communicators and policymakers improve messaging about water safety and other environmental threats by explaining how they are impacted by worsening severe weather."

Cuttlefish were fed with live shrimps injected with two Hg stable isotopic tracers (Me202Hg and 199Hg(II)), which allowed for the simultaneous quantification of internal Hg accumulation, Hg(II) methylation, and MeHg demethylation rates in different organs. Results showed that pCO2 had no impact on Hg bioaccumulation and organotropism, and both Hg and pCO2 did not influence the microbiota diversity of gut and digestive gland. However, the results also demonstrated that the digestive gland is a key organ for in vivo MeHg demethylation. Consequently, cuttlefish exposed to environmental levels of MeHg could exhibit in vivo MeHg demethylation. We hypothesize that in vivo MeHg demethylation could be due to biologically induced reactions or to abiotic reactions. This has important implications as to how some marine organisms may respond to future ocean change and global mercury contamination."

In this study, male zebrafish were exposed to 6:6 PFPiA (1 and 10 nM) for 28 days, which exhibited anxiety-like symptoms. Gut microbiome results indicated that 6:6 PFPiA significantly increased the abundance of Gram-negative bacteria, leading to enhanced levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and inflammation in the gut. The LPS was delivered to the brain through the gut- brain axis (GBA), damaged the blood-brain barrier (BBB), stimulated neuroinflammation, and caused apoptosis as well as neural injury in the brain. This mechanism was verified by the fact that antibiotics reduced the LPS levels in the gut and brain, accompanied by reduced inflammatory responses and anxiety-like behavior. The BBB damage also resulted in the enhanced accumulation of 6:6 PFPiA in the brain, where it might bind strongly with and activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) to induce brain inflammation directly. Additionally, as the fish received treatment with an inhibitor of AhR, the inflammation response and anxiety-like behavior decreased distinctly. This study sheds light on the new mechanisms of neurotoxicity-induced 6:6 PFPiA due to the interruption on GBA."

These disparities are often overlooked due to a lack of information on microlevel emission data, especially in smaller cities and rural areas. The current work in an Indian district, Saharanpur, proposes the use of novel data sets to estimate microlevel emissions from air-polluting infrastructure sectors in urban and rural areas for use in pollutant transport models. Health impacts estimated based on the surface PM2.5 concentration suggest that the rate of premature deaths is 158 (95% CI: 122- 163) and 143 (95% CI: 65-151) deaths per 100 000 people in urban and rural areas, respectively. Sixty-eight percent of the 6372 (95% CI: 3321-6987) annual premature deaths occurs in rural areas. Depicting higher contribution-exposure disparities among socioeconomic groups, the study observed that compared to their contribution to air pollution, low socioeconomic status (SES) groups in the region experience 6,7, 7, and 26% more premature deaths from PM2.5 exposure for industries, household cooking fuel burning, open waste burning, and transportation, respectively. The majority of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in the study domain are observed in economically weaker worker categories. Reduced income due to the loss of these life years will significantly impact these groups due to their dependence on daily wages for basic life necessities. Microlevel pollution mitigation policies with a focus on these inequalities are critical for promoting environmental equity and justice."

The complex cascade of reactions involved in biological action requires Cry proteins to be in solution. However, the pH-dependent changes in conformational stability and the adsorption-desorption mechanisms of Cry protein on soil minerals remain unclear. We used Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) calculation and differential scanning calorimetry to interpret the driving forces and structural stabilities of Cry1Ac and two contrasting model proteins adsorbed by montmorillonite. The structural stability of Cry1Ac is closer to that of the hard protein, alpha-chymotrypsin, than that of the soft bovine serum albumin (BSA). The pH-dependent adsorption of Cry1Ac and alpha-chymotrypsin could be explained by DLVO theory, whereas the BSA adsorption deviated from it. Patch controlled electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic effects, and entropy changes following protein unfolding on a mineral surface could contribute to Cry1Ac adsorption. Cry1Ac, like chymotrypsin, was partly denatured on montmorillonite, and its structural stability decreased with an increase in pH. Moreover, small changes in the conformational heterogeneity of both Cry1Ac and chymotrypsin were observed following adsorption.

Here, we integrate the two-dimensional volatility basis set into a state-of-theart chemical transport model, which unprecedentedly reproduces organic aerosol (OA) components resolved by the positive matrix factorization based on aerosol mass spectrometer observations. The model shows that, for Beijing, the emission reduction during the lockdown lowered primary organic aerosol (POA)/SOA concentrations by 50%/18%, while deteriorated meteorological conditions increased them by 30%/119%, resulting in a net decrease in the POA concentration and a net increase in the SOA concentration. Emission reduction and meteorological changes both led to an increased OH concentration, which accounts for their distinct effects on POA and SOA. SOA from anthropogenic volatile organic compounds and organics with lower volatility contributed 28 and 62%, respectively, to the net SOA increase. Different from Beijing, the SOA concentration decreased in southern Hebei during the lockdown because of more favorable meteorology. Our findings confirm the effectiveness of organic emission reductions and meanwhile reveal the challenge in controlling SOA pollution that calls for large organic precursor emission reductions to rival the adverse impact of OH increase."

To address the potential immunomodulatory effects of environmental Hg on Arctic organisms, we collected newborn barnacle goslings (Branta leucopsis) and herded them in either a control or mining site, differing in Hg levels. An additional group at the mining site was exposed to extra inorganic Hg(II) via supplementary feed. Hepatic total Hg concentrations differed significantly between the control (0.011 +/- 0.002 mg/kg dw), mine (0.043 +/- 0.011 mg/kg dw), and supplementary feed (0.713 +/- 0.137 mg/kg dw) gosling groups (average +/- standard deviation). Upon immune challenge with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) injection, endpoints for immune responses and oxidative stress were measured after 24 h. Our results indicated that Hg exposure modulated the immune responses in Arctic barnacle goslings upon a viral-like immune challenge. Increased exposure to both environmental as well as supplemental Hg reduced the level of natural antibodies, suggesting impaired humoral immunity. Hg exposure upregulated the expression of proinflammatory genes in the spleen, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and interleukin 18 (IL18), suggesting Hg-induced inflammatory effects. Exposure to Hg also oxidized glutathione (GSH) to glutathione disulfide (GSSG); however, goslings were capable of maintaining the redox balance by de novo synthesis of GSH. These adverse effects on the immune responses indicated that even exposure to low, environmentally relevant levels of Hg might affect immune competence at the individual level and might even increase the susceptibility of the population to infections."

Here, we present measurements of total gaseous mercury (TGM) monitored at a coastal mountaintop in Hong Kong downwind of mainland China. Sharp TGM peaks during cold front passages were frequently observed due to Asian pollution outflow with typical TGM/CO slopes of 6.8 +/- 2.2 pg m-3 ppbv-1. Contrary to the daytime maximums of other air pollutants, TGM exhibited a distinct diurnal variation with a midday minimum. Moreover, we observed four cases of extremely fast TGM depletion after sunrise, during which TGM concentrations rapidly dipped to 0.3-0.6 ng m-3 accompanied by other pollutants on the rise. Simulated meteorological fields revealed that morning upslope flow trans-porting anthropogenically polluted but TGM-depleted air masses from the mixed layer caused morning TGM depletion at the mountaintop location. The TGM-depleted air masses were hypothesized to result mainly from fast photooxidation of Hg after sunrise with minor contributions from dry deposition (5.0%) and nocturnal oxidation (0.6%). A bromine-induced two-step oxidation mechanism involving abundant pollutants (NO2, O3, etc.) was estimated to play a dominant role, contributing 55%-60% of depleted TGM and requiring 0.20-0.26 pptv Br, an amount potentially available through sea salt aerosol debromination. Our findings suggest significant effects of the interaction between anthropogenic pollution and marine halogen chemistry on atmospheric Hg cycling in the coastal areas."

In this study, the synergistic effects of SO2 and NH3 on SOA formation from gasoline evaporative VOCs with NOx were examined using a 30 m3 smog chamber with the aid of a series of mass spectrometers. Compared with the systems involving SO2 or NH3 alone, SO2 and NH3 coexistence had a greater promotion effect on SOA formation, which was larger than the cumulative effect of the two promotions alone. Meanwhile, contrasting effects of SO2 on the oxidation state (OSc) of SOA in the presence or absence of NH3 were observed, and SO2 could further increase the OSc with the coexistence of NH3. The latter was attributed to the synergistic effects of SO2 and NH3 coexistence on SOA formation, wherein N-S-O adducts can be formed from the reaction of SO2 with N-heterocycles generated in the presence of NH3. Our study contributes to the understanding of SOA formation from vehicle evaporative VOCs under highly complex pollution conditions and its atmospheric implications."

However, significant uncertainties remain in the source apportionment due to a lack of source-specific evaluation of Fe-laden aerosols. Here, the large uncertainties in the model estimates are investigated using different Fe emissions from metal production. The best agreement in the anthropogenic factor of aerosol Fe concentrations with the field data in the downstream region of East Asian outflow (median: 0.026 jig m-3) is obtained with the low case (0.023 jig m-3), whereas the best agreement of aerosol Fe bioaccessibility with field data (4.5%) over oceans south of 45 degrees S is obtained with the high case (4.9%). Our simulation with the low case confirms that anthropogenic aerosols play dominant roles in bioaccessible Fe deposition in the northwestern Pacific, compared to lithogenic sources. Our simulations with higher cases suggest that Fe-containing particles coemitted with sulfur dioxide from metal production substantially contribute to atmospheric bioaccessible Fe fluxes to the Southern Ocean. These findings highlight that accurate representation of aerosol Fe from metal production is a key to reduce large uncertainties in bioaccessible Fe deposition fluxes to the Southern Ocean (0.7-4.4 Gg Fe year-1)."

In the triphase system, the interface adsorption performance of emerging pollutants and the access pathway of O3, leading to a marked enhancement of interfacial pollutant concentration and O3 levels. These synergistic qualities result in high ciprofloxacin (CIP) removal efficiency (94.39%) and fast apparent reaction rate constant (kapp, 2.75 x 10-2 min-1) versus a traditional O3 process (41.82% and 0.48 x 10-2 min-1, respectively). In addition, this triphase system was an advanced oxidation process involving radical participation and showed excellent degradation performance of multiple emerging pollutants.

However, the effects of microplastics on S cycling in coastal sediments and their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, the transformation patterns of different S species in mangrove sediments amended with different microplastics and their associated microbial communities were investigated using stable isotopic analysis and metagenomic sequencing. Biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA) microplastics treatment increased sulfate (SO42-) reduction to yield more acid-volatile S and elementary S, which were subsequently transformed to chromium reducible S (CRS). The S isotope fractionation between SO42- and CRS in PLA treatment increased by 9.1%o from days 0 to 20, which was greater than 6.8%o in the control. In contrast, recalcitrant petroleum-based poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics had less impact on the sulfate reduction, resulting in 7.6 and 7.7%o of S isotope fractionation between SO42- and CRS from days 0 to 20, respectively. The pronounced S isotope fractionation in PLA treatment was associated with increased relative abundance of Desulfovibrio-related sulfate-reducing bacteria, which contributed a large proportion of the microbial genes responsible for dissimilatory sulfate reduction. Overall, these findings provide insights into the potential impacts of microplastics exposure on the biogeochemical S cycle in coastal sediments."

Wastewater influent samples from 60 communities, representing similar to 52% of Australia's population, were analyzed to quantify the concentration of analgesics used to treat pain and converted to estimates of the amount of drug consumed per day per 1000 inhabitants using pharmacokinetics and WBE data. Consumption was standardized to the defined daily dose per day per 1000 people. The population burden of pain treatment was classified as mild to moderate pain (for non-opioid analgesics) and strong to severe pain (for opioid analgesics). The mean per capita weighted total DDD of non-opioid analgesics was 0.029 DDD/day/person, and that of opioidbased analgesics was 0.037 DDD/day/person across Australia. A greater burden of pain (mild to moderate or strong to severe pain index) was observed at regional and remote sites. The correlation analysis of pain indices with different socioeconomic descriptors revealed that pain affects populations from high to low socioeconomic groups. Australians spent an estimated US $3.5 (AU $5) per day on analgesics. Our findings suggest that WBE could be an effective surveillance tool for estimating the consumption of analgesics at a population scale and assessing the total treated pain burden in communities."

We have found that sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and nitrate can be efficiently removed by the coculture of a model denitrifier (Paracoccus denitrificans, Pd) and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (So), and SMX degradation is affected by NADH production and electron transfer. In this paper, the mechanism of a coculture promoting NADH production and electron transfer was investigated by proteomic analysis and intermediate experiments. The results showed that glutamine and lactate produced by Pd were captured by So to synthesize thiamine and heme, and the released thiamine was taken up by Pd as a cofactor of pyruvate and ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which were related to NADH generation. Additionally, Pd acquired heme, which facilitated electron transfer as heme, was the important composition of complex III and cytochrome c and the iron source of iron sulfur clusters, the key component of complex I in the electron transfer chain. Further investigation revealed that lactate and glutamine generated by Pd prompted So chemotactic moving toward Pd, which helped the two bacteria effectively obtain their required substances. Obviously, metabolite cross-feeding promoted NADH production and electron transfer, resulting in efficient SMX biodegradation by Pd and So in the presence of nitrate. Its feasibility was finally verified by the coculture of an activated sludge denitrifier and So."

However, metal-chlorocomplex formation under high chloride conditions could deactivate the catalyst and reduce the process efficiency. Herein, in situ electrogenerated HOCl was activated to center dot OH via a metal-free, B/N-codoped carbon nanofiber cathode for the first time to degrade contaminant under high chloride condition. The results show 98% degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) within 120 min (k = 0.036 min-1) under sulfate conditions, while complete degradation (k = 0.188 min-1) was obtained in only 30 min under chloride conditions. An enhanced degradation mechanism consists of an Adsorb & Shuttle process, wherein adsorption concentrates the pollutants at the cathode surface and they are subsequently oxidized by the large amount of center dot OH produced via activation of HOCl and H2O2 at the cathode. Density functional theory calculations verify the pyridinic N as the active site for the activation of HOCl and H2O2. The process efficiency was also evaluated by treating tetracycline and bisphenol A as well as high chloride-containing real secondary effluents from a pesticide manufacturing plant. High yields of center dot OH and HOCl allow continuous regeneration of the cathode for several cycles, limiting its fast deactivation, which is promising for real application."

Herein, we established QSAR models updated with density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning approaches to predict the degradation perform-ance for a series of contaminants in heterogeneous PMS systems. We imported the characteristics of organic molecules calculated using constrained DFT as input descriptors and predicted the apparent degradation rate constants of contaminants as the output. The genetic algorithm and deep neural networks were used to improve the predictive accuracy. The qualitative and quantitative results from the QSAR model for the degradation of contaminants can be used to select the most appropriate treatment system. A strategy for selection of the optimum catalyst for PMS treatment of specific contaminants was also established according to the QSAR models.

Meanwhile, CFA as a large industrial waste stream in the United States (U.S.) poses significant environmental and economic burdens. Recovery of REEs from CFA is a promising solution to the REE scarcity issue and also brings opportunities for CFA management. This study demonstrates a green system for REE recovery from Class F and C CFA that consists of three modules: REE leaching using citrate, REE separation and concentration using oxalate, and zeolite synthesis using secondary wastes from Modules I and II. In Module I,similar to 10 and 60% REEs were leached from the Class F and C CFA samples, respectively, using citrate at pH 4. In Module II, the addition of oxalate selectively precipitated and concentrated REEs from the leachate via the formation of weddellite (CaC2O4 center dot 2H2O), while other trace metals remained in solution. In Module III, zeolite was synthesized using wastes from Modules I and II. This study is characterized by the successful recovery of REEs and upcycling of secondary wastes, which addresses both REE recovery and CFA management challenges."

A significant challenge associated with these efforts is the need for accurate partitioning data for an everexpanding list of OCs and breakdown products. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have the potential to help generate these data, but existing studies have applied these techniques only to a limited variety of OCs. Here, we use established MD simulation approaches to examine the partitioning of 82 OCs, including many compounds of critical concern, at the water-air interface. Our predictions of the Henry's law constant (KH) and interfacial adsorption coefficients (Kiw, Kia) correlate strongly with experimental results, indicating that MD simulations can be used to predict KH, Kiw, and Kia values with mean absolute deviations of 1.1, 0.3, and 0.3 logarithmic units after correcting for systematic bias, respectively. A library of MD simulation input files for the examined OCs is provided to facilitate future investigations of the partitioning of these compounds in the presence of other phases."

However, EABs usually decay during long-term operation, and, until now, the causes remain unknown. Here, we report that lysogenic phages can cause EAB decay in Geobacter sulfurreducens fuel cells. A cross-streak agar assay and bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of prophages on the G. sulfurreducens genome, and a mitomycin C induction assay revealed the lysogenic to lytic transition of those prophages, resulting in a progressive decay in both current generation and the EAB. Furthermore, the addition of phages purified from decayed EAB resulted in accelerated decay of the EAB, thereafter contributing to a faster decline in current generation; otherwise, deleting prophage-related genes rescued the decay process. Our study provides the first evidence of an interaction between phages and electroactive bacteria and suggests that attack by phages is a primary cause of EAB decay, having significant implications in bioelectrochemical systems."

In this contribution, statistical and geochemical analyses of well-constrained metadata of Indian groundwater quality (n = 342 of 8543) were performed to identify key parameters and processes that influence U concentrations. For geochemical predictions, a unified speciation model was developed from a carefully compiled and updated thermodynamic database of inorganic, organic (Stockholm Humic model), and surface complexation reactions and associated constants. Critical U contamination was found at shallow depths (< 100 m) within the Indo-Gangetic plain, as determined by bivariate nonparametric Kendall's Taub and probability-based association tests. Analysis of aquifer redox states, multivariate hierarchical clusters, and principal components indicated that U contamination was predominant not just in oxic but mixed (oxic-anoxic) aquifers under high Fe, Mn, and SO4 concentrations, presumably due to U release from dissolution of Fe/Mn oxides or Fe sulfides and silicate weathering. Most groundwaters were undersaturated with respect to relevant U-bearing solids despite being supersaturated with respect to atmospheric CO2 (average pCO(2)of reported dissolved inorganic carbonate (DIC) data = 10(-1.57 )atm). Yet, dissolved U did not appear to be mass limited, as predicted solubilities from reported sediment concentrations of U were similar to 3 orders of magnitude higher. Integration of surface complexation models of U on typical aquifer adsorbents, ferrihydrite, goethite, and manganese dioxide, was necessary to explain dissolved U concentrations. Uranium contamination probabilities with increasing dissolved Ca and Mn exhibited minima at equilibrium solubilities of calcite [similar to 50 mg L-1] and rhodochrosite [similar to 0.14 mg L-1], respectively, at an average groundwater pH of similar to 7.5. A potential indirect control of such U-free carbonate solids on U mobilization was suggested. For locations (n = 37) where dissolved organic carbon was also reported, organic complexes of U contributed negligibly to dominant U speciation at the groundwater pH. Overall, the unified model suggested competitive dissolution-precipitation and adsorption-desorption controls on U speciation. The model provides a quantitative framework that can be extended to understand dominant mobilization mechanisms of geogenic U in aquifers worldwide after suitable modifications to the relevant aquifer parameters."

However, key toxicity drivers have not been reported via comprehensive evaluation based on the formation of aliphatic and aromatic DBPs in drinking water. In this study, the occurrence of 37 aliphatic and 19 aromatic DBPs in drinking samples with different water characteristics collected in a Chinese megacity was explored. According to the individual DBP concentrations and cytotoxicity potencies as well as the TIC-Tox method, haloacetonitriles and halonitrophenols were found to be the toxicity drivers among the measured aliphatic and aromatic DBPs, respectively. However, when aromatic and aliphatic DBPs are taken into consideration together, aliphatic DBPs were calculated to present higher toxicity contribution than aromatic DBPs, which is inconsistent with the previous study. TOX showed significant positive correlations with most aliphatic DBPs but no aromatic DBPs, and the overall toxicity of the water sample concentrates is significantly related to the total calculated cytotoxicity and aliphatic DBPs, suggesting that current selected aromatic DBPs are insufficient to represent the overall aromatic DBPs. UV254 and DOC rather than SUVA are better surrogates for predicting DBP formation potential for DOM with a lower humification degree as indicated by fluorescence results."

In vitro threedimensional (3D) hepatospheroid cell culture was utilized to explore the potential mechanisms of EHDPP-mediated metabolic disruption through morphological, transcriptional, and biochemical assays. Lipidomics analysis was performed on the individual hepatospheroids to investigate the effects on intracellular lipid profiles, followed by hepatospheroid morphology, growth, functional parameters, and cytotoxicity evaluation. The possible mechanisms were delineated using the genelevel analysis by assessing the expression of key genes encoding for hepatic lipid metabolism. We revealed that exposure to EHDPP at 1 and 10 mu M for 7 days alters the lipid profile of human 3D hepatospheroids. Dysregulation in several lipid classes, including sterol lipids (cholesterol esters), sphingolipids (dihydroceramide, hexosylceramide, ceramide, sphingomyelin), glycerolipids (triglycerides), glycerophospholipids, and fatty acyls, was noted along with alteration in genes including ACAT1, ACAT2, CYP27A1, ABCA1, GPAT2, PNPLA2, PGC1 alpha, and Nrf2.

The potential for PFAS bioconcentration from exposure to the contaminated groundwater, which discharges to surface water bodies, was assessed with mobile-laboratory experiments using groundwater from the contamination plume and a nearby reference location. The on-site continuous-flow 21-day exposures used male and female fathead minnows, freshwater mussels, polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS), and polyethylene tube samplers (PETS) to evaluate biotic and abiotic uptake. The composition of the PFAS-contaminated groundwater was complex and 9 PFAS were detected in the reference groundwater and 17 PFAS were detected in the contaminated groundwater. The summed PFAS concentrations ranged from 120 to 140 ng L-1 in reference groundwater and 6100 to 15,000 ng L-1 in contaminated groundwater. Biotic concentration factors (CFb) for individual PFAS were species, sex, source, and compound-specific and ranged from 2.9 to 1000 L kg-1 in whole-body male fish exposed to contaminated groundwater for 21 days. The fish and mussel CFb generally increased with increasing fluorocarbon chain length and were greater for sulfonates than for carboxylates. The exception was perfluorohexane sulfonate, which deviated from the linear trend and had a 10-fold difference in CFb between sites, possibly because of biotransformation of precursors such as perfluorohexane sulfonamide. Uptake for most PFAS in male fish was linear over time, whereas female fish had bilinear uptake indicated by an initial increase in tissue concentrations followed by a decrease. Uptake of PFAS was less for mussels (maximum CFb = 200) than for fish, and mussel uptake of most PFAS also was bilinear. Although abiotic concentration factors were greater than CFb, and values for POCIS were greater than for PETS, passive samplers were useful for assessing PFAS that potentially bioconcentrate in fish but are present at concentrations below method quantitation limits in water.

While it is well-documented that Fenton reactions produce hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) under acidic conditions, we demonstrated the generation of ferryl ion (FeIVO2+) in the UV/Fe(III) and UV/ Fe(III)/H2O2 systems at pH 2.8 using methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) as the probe compound. Moreover, we clarified that FeIVO2+ is parallelly formed via the oxidation of Fe(III) by HO center dot and the O-O homolysis of [FeIII-OOH]2+ in the photo-Fenton process. The rate constant for the reaction between HO center dot and Fe3+ measured by laser flash photolysis was 4.41 x 107 M-1 s-1. The rate constant and quantum yield for thermal and photo O-O homolysis of [FeIII-OOH]2+ complex were 1.4 x 10-2 s-1 and 0.3, respectively, which were determined by fitting PMSO2 formation. While FeIVO2+ forms predominantly through the reaction between HO center dot and Fe3+ in the absence of H2O2, the relative contribution of [FeIII-OOH]2+ O-O homolysis to FeIVO2+ formation highly depends on the molar ratio of [H2O2]0/[Fe(III)]0, the level of HO center dot scavenging, and incident irradiance in the UV/Fe(III)/H2O2 system. Accordingly, an optimized kinetic model was developed by incorporating FeIVO2+-involved reactions into the conventional photo-Fenton model, which can accurately predict Fe(II) formation and contaminant decay in the UV/Fe(III) and UV/Fe(III)/ H2O2 systems. Our study illuminated the underlying formation mechanism of reactive oxidative species in the photo-Fenton process and highlighted the role of FeIVO2+ evolution in modulating the iron cycle and pollutant abatement therein."

Oxygenation of mineral-bound Fe(II) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), yet it is unknown whether and how this process alters the activity and functional lifespan of extracellular enzymes. Here, the effect of mineral-bound Fe(II) oxidation on the hydrolytic activity of a cellulose-degrading enzyme beta-glucosidase (BG) was studied using two pre-reduced Fe-bearing clay minerals (nontronite and montmorillonite) and one pre-reduced iron oxide (magnetite) at pH 5 and 7. Under anoxic conditions, BG adsorption to mineral surfaces decreased its activity but prolonged its lifespan. Under oxic conditions, ROS was produced, with the amount of center dot OH, the most abundant ROS, being positively correlated with the extent of structural Fe(II) oxidation in reduced minerals. center dot OH decreased BG activity and shortened its lifespan via conformational change and structural decomposition of BG. These results suggest that under oxic conditions, the ROS-induced inhibitory role of Fe(II)-bearing minerals outweighed their adsorption-induced protective role in controlling enzyme activity. These results disclose a previously unknown mechanism of extracellular enzyme inactivation, which have pivotal implications for predicting the active enzyme pool in redox-oscillating environments."

Although their coexistence in oceans and the associated MP-oil-dispersant agglomerates (MODAs) have been reported, limited attention is given to the behavior of the co -contaminants. This study investigated MODA transport in a simulated ocean system and explored related mechanisms under various oil types, salinities, and mineral concentrations. We found that more than 90% of the heavy oil-formed MODAs stayed at the seawater surface, while the light oil-formed MODAs were widely distributed throughout the seawater column. The increased salinity promoted MODAs formed by 7 and 90 mu m MPs to transport from the seawater surface to the column. This was elucidated by the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory as more MODAs formed under higher salinities and dispersants kept them stable in the seawater column. Minerals facilitated the sinking of large MP -formed MODAs (e.g., 40 mu m) as minerals were adsorbed on the MODA surface, but their impact on small MP-formed MODAs (e.g., 7 mu m) was negligible. A MODA-mineral system was proposed to explain their interaction. Rubey ' s equation was recommended to predict the sinking velocity of MODAs. This study is the first attempt to reveal MODA transport. Findings will contribute to the model development to facilitate their environmental risk evaluation in oceans."

Lipids, the main cytomembrane structural biomolecules, normally play indispensable roles in guaranteeing cell functionality. However, no studies explored the effects of high ammonia on acetotrophic methanogens' lipids. Here, a high-throughput lipidomic interrogation deciphered lipid reprogramming in representative acetoclastic methanogen (Methanosarcina barkeri) upon high ammonia exposure. The results showed that high ammonia conspicuously reduced polyunsaturated lipids and longer chain lipids, while accumulating lipids with shorter chains and/or more saturation. Also, the correlation network analysis visualized some sphingolipids as the most active participant in lipid-lipid communications, implying that the ammonia-induced enrichment in these sphingolipids triggered other lipid changes. In addition, we discovered the decreased integrity, elevated permeability, depolarization, and diminished fluidity of lipid-supported membranes under ammonia restraint, verifying the noxious ramifications of lipid abnormalities. Additional analysis revealed that high ammonia destabilized the structure of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) capable of protecting lipids, e.g., declining alpha-helix/(beta-sheet + random coil) and 3-turn helix ratios. Furthermore, the abiotic impairment of critical EPS bonds, including C-OH, C-O-NH-, and S-S, and the biotic downregulation of functional proteins involved in transcription, translation, and EPS building blocks' supply were unraveled under ammonia stress and implied as the crucial mechanisms for EPS reshaping."

From the aspect of energy minimization calculated by DFT, in-layered Ce doping is also recommended due to the decreased energies for molecule adsorption and oxygen vacancy formation. As a result, in-layered Ce-doped MnO2 displays exceptional activity in catalyzing the deep oxidation of HCHO and a fourfold higher capacity of ambient HCHO storage than pristine MnO2.

Ionic FBs exhibited much higher concentrations than nonionic FBs. The total sludge concentrations of 25 FBs (Sigma(25)FBs) ranged from 7300 to 1,520,000 ng/g, with a median of 35,300 ng/g. A clear geographical distribution of significantly higher concentrations of FBs was found in East and Central China than in West China (p < 0.05). The sludge concentrations of Sigma(25)FBs were correlated well with the gross domestic product (GDP) and population size at the provincial level in China (p < 0.05), demonstrating the significance of anthropogenic impacts on FB levels in urban sludge. The nationwide annual emission of total FBs into sludge in China is estimated to be 835 tons/year, of which 134 tons/year is directly released into sludge-applied soils.

A compelling example is N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N '- phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD)-derived quinone, called 6PPD-Q, as the causal toxicant for stormwater-linked acute mortality toward coho salmon. However, the knowledge of the co-occurrences of PPDs and PPD-Qs and their transport from freshwater to oceanic waterbodies on a large geographical scale remains unknown. Herein, we performed the first large-scale survey of these chemicals in sediments across urban rivers, estuaries, coasts, and deep-sea regions. Our results demonstrated that seven PPDs and four PPD-Qs are ubiquitously present in riverine, estuarine, and coastal sediments, and most of them also occur in deep-sea sediments. The most dominant chemicals of concern were identified as 6PPD and 6PPD-Q. Total sedimentary concentrations of PPDs and PPD-Qs presented a clear spatial trend with decreasing levels from urban rivers (medians: 39.7 and 15.2 ng/g) to estuaries (14.0 and 5.85 ng/g) and then toward coasts (9.47 and 2.97 ng/g) and deep-sea regions (5.24 and 3.96 ng/g). Interestingly, spatial variation in the ratios of 6PPD to 6PPD-Q (R6PPD/6PPD-Q) also presented a clear decreasing trend. Our field measurements implied that riverine outflows of PPDs and PPD-Qs may be an important route to transport these tire rubber-derived chemicals to coastal and open oceans."

However, whether frequent exposure, via dermal contact and inadvertent oral ingestion, results in occupational diseases is unknown, as is the potential exacerbation of toxicity by high-intensity irradiation from stage lights. In this study, we examined the release of Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn from 40 face paints and the consequent health risks posed by different practical scenarios involving their use. The results showed that the in vitro bioaccessibility (IVBA) of Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn in the tested products was, on average, 7.0, 5.5, 19.9, and 7.9% through oral ingestion and 1.1, 2.2, 1.6, and 1.2% through dermal contact, respectively. Stage light irradiation significantly increased the IVBA associated with dermal contact, to the average of 4.8, 34.9, 5.7, and 1.9% for Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn, respectively. The increase was mainly due to the light-induced generation of reactive oxygen species, particularly hydroxyl free radicals. The vitality and transcriptional response of 3D skin models as well as a quantitative risk assessment of skin sensitization indicated that dermal contact with face paints may induce predictable skin damage and potentially other skin diseases. Long-term exposure to face paints on stage may also pose a non-carcinogenic health risk. The demonstrated health risks to opera performers of face paint exposure should lead to strict regulations regarding the content of theatrical face paints."

Computational modeling approaches have emerged as low-cost alternatives, especially those used to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. However, conventional QSAR models have limited training data, leading to low predictivity for new compounds. We developed a data-driven modeling approach for constructing carcinogenicityrelated models and used these models to identify potential new human carcinogens. To this goal, we used a probe carcinogen dataset from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) to identify relevant PubChem bioassays. Responses of 25 PubChem assays were significantly relevant to carcinogenicity. Eight assays inferred carcinogenicity predictivity and were selected for QSAR model training. Using 5 machine learning algorithms and 3 types of chemical fingerprints, 15 QSAR models were developed for each PubChem assay dataset. These models showed acceptable predictivity during 5-fold cross-validation (average CCR = 0.71). Using our QSAR models, we can correctly predict and rank 342 IRIS compounds' carcinogenic potentials (PPV = 0.72). The models predicted potential new carcinogens, which were validated by a literature search. This study portends an automated technique that can be applied to prioritize potential toxicants using validated QSAR models based on extensive training sets from public data resources."

At an applied potential of +0.020 V, the stainless-steel electrode produced center dot OH with a yield that was over an order of magnitude higher than that reported for other systems that employ iron oxides as catalysts under circumneutral pH conditions. Decreasing the applied potential at pH 8 and 9 enhanced the rate of H2O2 loss by shifting the process to a reaction mechanism that resulted in the formation of an Fe(IV) species. Significant metal leaching was only observed under acidic pH conditions (i.e., at pH <6), with the release of dissolved Fe and Cr occurring as the thickness of the passivation layer decreased. Despite the relatively high yield of center dot OH production under circumneutral pH conditions, most of the oxidants were scavenged by the electrode surface when contaminant concentrations comparable to those expected in drinking water sources were tested. The stainless-steel electrode efficiently removed trace organic contaminants from an authentic surface water sample without contaminating the water with Fe and Cr. With further development, stainless-steel electrodes could provide a cost-effective alternative to other H2O2 activation processes, such as those by ultraviolet light."

The prevalent SPAs in the samples were butylated hydroxytoluene, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, pentaerythritol tetrakis[3(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate] (AO 1010), and octadecyl 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) propionate (AO 1076). Source analysis indicated that the prevalence of these four SPAs in baby food was associated with contamination of packaging materials, mechanical processing, or raw ingredients. Migration experiments demonstrated that contamination of plastic packaging constituted an important source. Exposure assessment suggested that there may be no appreciable health risk posed by the SPAs in baby food. Even so, baby food consumption was still a dominant pathway for infant exposure to SPAs, with a higher contribution than breast milk consumption, dust ingestion, dermal dust absorption, and air inhalation, which requires special attention."

However, the mechanism of selenite uptake by microorganisms, the first step through which Se exerts its cellular function, remains not well studied. In this study, the effects of selenite concentration, time, pH, metabolic inhibitors, and anionic analogues on selenite uptake in Rahnella aquatilis HX2 were investigated. Selenite uptake by R. aquatilis HX2 was concentration- and time-dependent, and its transport activity was significantly dependent on pH. In addition, selenite uptake in R. aquatilis HX2 was significantly inhibited by the aquaporin inhibitor AgNO3 and sulfite (SO32-), and partially inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) treatments. Three mutants with in-frame deletions of aqpZ, glpF, and nhaA genes were constructed. The transport assay showed that the water channel protein AqpZ, and not GlpF, was a key channel of selenite uptake by R. aquatilis HX2, and sulfite and selenite had a common uptake pathway. In addition, the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA is also involved in selenite uptake in R. aquatilis HX2.

Herein, we propose a novel and facile strategy to fabricate omniphobic membranes with exceptionally robust MD performance. Specifically, a substrate with a hierarchical re-entrant architecture was constructed via spray-water-assisted non-solvent-induced phase separation (SWNIPS), followed by a direct fluorinated surface decoration via thiol-ene click chemistry. Deionized (DI) water contact angle measurements revealed an ultrahigh surface water contact angle (166.8 +/- 1.8 degrees) and an ultralow sliding angle (3.6 +/- 1.1 degrees) of the resultant membrane. Destructive abrasion cycle and ultrasonication tests confirmed its structural robustness. Moreover, the membrane possessed excellent wetting resistance, as evidenced by the prevention of membrane pore penetration by all low-surface-tension testing liquids, allowing stable long-term MD operation to treat brine wastewater with a surfactant content of 0.6 mM. In a desalination experiment using shale gas wastewater, the omniphobic membrane exhibited robust MD performance, achieving a high water recovery ratio of similar to 60% without apparent changes in water flux and permeate conductivity over the entire membrane process. Overall, our study paves the way for a nanoparticle-free methodology for the scalable fabrication of high -performance MD membranes with surface omniphobicity and structural robustness in hypersaline wastewater treatment."

Diketonitrile also may impact water quality by acting as a precursor for dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), which is an unregulated but highly toxic disinfection byproduct (DBP). In this study, we investigated the reaction of diketonitrile with free chlorine and chloramine to form DCAN. We found that diketonitrile reacts with free chlorine within seconds but reacts with chloramine on the time scale of hours to days. In the presence of both oxidants, DCAN was generated at yields up to 100%. Diketonitrile reacted fastest with chlorine at circumneutral pH, which was consistent with base-catalyzed halogenation involving the enolate form of diketonitrile present at alkaline pH and electrophilic hypochlorous acid, which decreases in abundance above its pKa (7.5). In contrast, we found that diketonitrile reacts faster with chloramine as pH values decreased, consistent with an attack on the enolate by electrophilic protonated monochloramine that increases in abundance at acidic pH approaching its pKa (1.6). Our results indicate that increasing isoxaflutole use, particularly in light of the recent release of genetically modified isoxaflutole-tolerant crops, could result in greater occurrences of a high-yield DCAN precursor during disinfection."

However, the acidification of wastewater caused by ferric hydrolysis in CEPT and how to achieve stable suppression of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in PN/A challenge this paradigm in practice. This study proposes a novel wastewater treatment scheme to overcome these challenges. Results showed that, by dosing FeCl3 at 50 mg Fe/L, the CEPT process removed 61.8% of COD and 90.1% of phosphate and reduced the alkalinity as well. Feeding by low alkalinity wastewater, stable nitrite accumulation was achieved in an aerobic reactor operated at pH 4.35 aided by a novel acid-tolerant ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), namely, Candidatus Nitrosoglobus. After polishing in a following anoxic reactor (anammox), a satisfactory effluent, containing COD at 41.9 +/- 11.2 mg/L, total nitrogen at 5.1 +/- 1.8 mg N/ L, and phosphate at 0.3 +/- 0.2 mg P/L, was achieved. Moreover, the stable performances of this integration were well maintained at an operating temperature of 12 degrees C, and 10 investigated micropollutants were removed from the wastewater.

Passive NOx adsorbers (PNA), which could temporarily capture NOx at low temperatures (below 200 degrees C) and release the stored NOx at higher temperatures (normally 250-450 degrees C) to downstream selective catalytic reduction unit for complete abatement, hold promise to mitigate cold-start NOx emissions. In this review, recent advances in material design, mechanism understanding, and system integration are summarized for PNA based on palladium-exchanged zeolites. First, we discuss the choices of parent zeolite, Pd precursor, and synthetic method for the synthesis of Pd-zeolites with atomic Pd dispersions, and review the effect of hydrothermal aging on the properties and PNA performance of Pd-zeolites. Then, we show how different experimental and theoretical methodologies can be integrated to gain mechanistic insights into the nature of Pd active sites, the NOx storage/release chemistry, as well as the interactions between Pd and typical components/poisons in engine exhausts. This review also gathers several novel designs of PNA integration into modern exhaust after-treatment systems for practical application. At the end, we discuss the major challenges, as well as important implications, for the further development and real application of Pd-zeolite-based PNA in cold-start NOx mitigation."

Studies have shown that bacteria-cyanobacteria interactions contributed significantly to phytoplankton dynamics. However, information on the contribution of bacterial communities to blooms remains scarce. Here, we tracked changes in the bacterial community during the development of a cyanobacterial bloom in an equatorial estuarine reservoir. Two forms of blooms were observed simultaneously corresponding to the lotic and lentic characteristics of the sampling sites where significant spatial variabilities in physicochemical water quality, cyanobacterial biomass, secondary metabolites, and cyanobacterial/ bacterial compositions were detected. Microcystis dominated the upstream sites during peak periods and were succeeded by Synechococcus when the bloom subsided. For the main body of the reservoir, a mixed bloom featuring coccoid and filamentous cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Synechococcus, Planktothricoides, Nodosilinea, Raphidiopsis, and Prochlorothrix) was observed. Concentrations of the picocyano-bacteria Synechococcus remained high throughout the study, and their positive correlations with cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin-a suggested that they could produce cyanotoxins, which pose more damaging impacts than previously supposed. Succession of different cyanobacteria (Synechococcus and Microcystis) following changes in nutrient composition and ionic strength was demonstrated. The microbiomes associated with blooms were unique to the dominant cyanobacteria. Generic and specialized bloom biomarkers for the Microcystis and downstream mixed blooms were also identified. Microscillaceae, Chthoniobacteraceae, and Roseomonas were the major heterotrophic bacteria associated with Microcystis bloom, whereas Phycisphaeraceae and Methylacidiphilaceae were the most prominent groups for the Synechococcus bloom. Collectively, bacterial community can be greatly deviated by the geological condition, monsoon season, cyanobacterial density, and dominant cyanobacteria."

The effects of nutrient imbalances such as silicon (Si) limitation on the interactions between diatoms and MPs remain poorly understood. In contrast to previous studies which mainly focused on MP toxicity, this study emphasizes how Si availability affects nano-scale interactions between pristine polystyrene MPs and diatom surfaces. Results showed that Si-starved cells were less tolerant to MP toxicity than the Si-enriched counterparts. Si limitation significantly changed the configuration and chemical composition of the perforated frustules, forming less negatively charged, more adhesive, and mechanically weaker cells. All of these changes facilitated the adsorption and hetero-aggregation between the diatom cells and MPs and compromised the diatoms' resistance to MP attack. Our study provides novel insights into the effects of pristine MPs in the marine environment under the context of dynamic nutrient conditions."

Here, we measured the physical properties of a silt loam in response to the incorporation of polyester fibers and polypropylene granules over a wide range of concentrations. We further elucidated the underlying mechanisms by determining the role of microplastic shape and the baseline effects from the amendment of soil particles. The incorporation of microplastics into soil tended to increase contact angle and saturated hydraulic conductivity and decrease bulk density and water holding capacity, but not affect aggregate stability. Polyester fibers affected soil physical properties more profoundly than polypropylene granules, due to the vastly different shape of fibers from that of soil particles. However, changes in soil properties were gradual, and significant changes did not occur until a high concentration of microplastics was reached (i.e., 0.5% w/w for polyester fibers and 2% w/w for polypropylene granules). Currently, microplastic concentrations in soils not heavily polluted with plastics are far below these concentrations, and results from this study suggest that microplastics at environmentally relevant concentrations have no significant effects on soil physical properties."

However, despite diverse n-DAMO bacteria widely detected in environments, little is known about their physiology for microbial niche differentiation. Here, we show the microbial niche differentiation of n-DAMO bacteria through long-term reactor operations combining genome-centered omics and kinetic analysis. With the same inoculum dominated by both species Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera and Candida-tus Methylomirabilis sinica, n-DAMO bacterial population was shifted to Ca. M. oxyfera in a reactor fed with low-strength nitrite, but shifted to Ca. M. sinica with high-strength nitrite. Metatranscriptomic analysis showed that Ca. M. oxyfera harbored more complete function in cell chemotaxis, flagellar assembly, and two-component system for better uptake of nitrite, while Ca. M. sinica had a more active ion transport and stress response system, and more redundant function in nitrite reduction to mitigate nitrite inhibition. Importantly, the half-saturation constant of nitrite (0.057 mM vs 0.334 mM NO2-) and inhibition thresholds (0.932 mM vs 2.450 mM NO2-) for Ca. M. oxyfera vs Ca. M. sinica, respectively, were highly consistent with genomic results.

In this study, the particle size dependency of peff was determined for fresh and photochemically aged particles from residential combustion of wood logs and brown coal, as well as from an aerosol standard (CAST) burner. peff increased considerably due to photochemical aging, especially for soot agglomerates larger than 100 nm in mobility diameter. The increase depends on the presence of condensable vapors and agglomerate size and can be explained by collapsing of chain-like agglomerates and filling of their voids and formation of secondary coating. The measured and modeled particle optical properties suggest that while light absorption, scattering, and the single-scattering albedo of soot particle increase during photochemical processing, their radiative forcing remains positive until the amount of nonabsorbing coating exceeds approximately 90% of the particle mass."

The aims of the present study were to identify hazards of low-dose ionizing radiation to Daphnia magna using multiomics dose-response modeling and to demonstrate the use of omics data to support an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network development for ionizing radiation. Neonatal D. magna were exposed to gamma radiation for 8 days. Transcriptomic analysis was performed after 4 and 8 days of exposure, whereas metabolomics and confirmative bioassays to support the omics analyses were conducted after 8 days of exposure. Benchmark doses (BMDs, 10% benchmark response) as points of departure (PODs) were estimated for both dose-responsive genes/ metabolites and the enriched KEGG pathways. Relevant pathways derived using the BMD modeling and additional functional end points measured by the bioassays were overlaid with a previously published AOP network. The results showed that several molecular pathways were highly relevant to the known modes of action of gamma radiation, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein degradation, and apoptosis. The functional assays showed increased oxidative stress and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP pool. Ranking of PODs at the pathway and functional levels showed that oxidative damage related functions had relatively low PODs, followed by DNA damage, energy metabolism, and apoptosis. These were supportive of causal events in the proposed AOP network. This approach yielded promising results and can potentially provide additional empirical evidence to support further AOP development for ionizing radiation."

The presence of co-diets enhanced LDPE consumption in both larvae and broad-depolymerized the ingested LDPE. The diet type shaped gut microbial diversity, potential pathways, and metabolic functions. The sequence of effectiveness of co-diets was WB or CF > CS > RS for larval development and LDPE degradation. Co-occurrence networks indicated that the larvae co-fed with LDPE displayed more complex correlations of gut microbiome than the larvae fed with single diets. The primary diet of WB or CF and crop residues CS and RS provided energy and nitrogen source to significantly enhance LDPE biodegradation with synergistic activities of the gut microbiota. For the larvae fed LDPE and LDPE plus co-diets, nitrogen fixation function was stimulated compared to normal diets and associated with LDPE biodegradation."

This study is the first report of the combination of ferrate(VI) (Fe(VI)) and periodate (PI) for synergistic, rapid, and selective elimination of multiple micropollutants. This combined system was found to outperform other Fe(VI)/oxidant systems (e.g., H2O2, peroxydisulfate, and peroxymonosulfate) in rapid water decontamination. Scavenging, probing, and electron spin resonance experiments showed that high-valent Fe(IV)/Fe(V) intermediates, rather than hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, singlet oxygen, and iodyl radicals, played a dominant role in the process. Further, the generation of Fe(IV)/Fe(V) was evidenced directly by the 57Fe Mo''ssbauer spectroscopic test. Surprisingly, the reactivity of PI toward Fe(VI) is rather low (0.8223 M-1 s-1) at pH 8.0, implying that PI was not acting as an activator. Besides, as the only iodine sink of PI, iodate also played an enhanced role in micropollutant abatement by Fe(VI) oxidation. Further experiments proved that PI and/or iodate might function as the Fe(IV)/Fe(V) ligands, causing the utilization efficiency of Fe(IV)/Fe(V) intermediates for pollutant oxidation to outcompete their auto-decomposition. Finally, the oxidized products and plausible transformation pathways of three different micropollutants by single Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)/PI oxidation were characterized and elucidated. Overall, this study proposed a novel selective oxidation strategy (i.e., Fe(VI)/PI system) that could efficiently eliminate water micropollutants and clarified the unexpected interactions between PI/iodate and Fe(VI) for accelerated oxidation."

Lessons from a Study of United Kingdom Plastics Flows"	"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY"			"English"	"Article"						"Plastics; Recycling; Demand; Stocks; Greenhouse gas emissions; United Kingdom; Trade"	"LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; PET"	"Plastics are one of the most widely used materials on the planet, owing to their usefulness, durability, and relatively low cost. Yet, making, using, and disposing of plastics create important environmental impacts, most notably greenhouse gas emissions and waste pollution. Reducing these impacts while still enjoying the benefits of plastic use requires an integrated assessment of all of the life cycles of plastics. This has rarely been attempted due to the wide variety of polymers and the lack of knowledge on the final uses and applications of plastics. Using trade statistics for 464 product codes, we have mapped the flows of the 11 most widely used polymers from production into six end-use applications for the United Kingdom (UK) in 2017. With a dynamic material flow analysis, we have anticipated demand and waste generation until 2050. We found that the demand for plastics seems to have saturated in the UK, with an annual demand of 6 Mt, responsible for approximately 26 Mt CO2e/a. Owing to a limited recycling capacity in the UK, only 12% of UK plastic waste is recycled domestically, leading to 21% of the waste being exported, labeled as recycling, but mostly to countries with poor practices of waste management. Increasing recycling capacity in the UK could both reduce GHG emissions and prevent waste pollution. This intervention should be complemented with improved practices in the production of primary plastics, which currently accounts for 80% of UK plastic emissions."

Nevertheless, its global sustainability is not well addressed. Here, using dynamic substance flow analysis, we study the indium industry evolution between 2010 and 2020 and estimate its future demand in the medium and long term toward 2050 to identify potential paths and mechanisms to decrease indium losses and to identify the key stages in its life cycle. As electronics and photovoltaic industries will play a crucial role in the indium demand, we assess their indium demand employing three cumulative photovoltaic capacity scenarios (8.5, 14, and 60 TW by 2050) with different dominant photovoltaic subtechnologies. Results show that liquid-crystal displays and photovoltaic panels will drive indium future demand, increasing its current demand by 2.2-4.2, 2.6-7.0, and 6.8-38.3 times for the 8.5, 14, and 60 TW scenarios, respectively, threatening with shortages that could occur as early as the next decade. Therefore, measures to reduce losses in primary production, innovations and improvements in electronics and solar panels, and indium recycling with an effective circular economy strategy could promote and secure the future sustainability of indium."

In this study, we surprisingly found that the level of TOX in chlorinated waters had been significantly underestimated under common analytical conditions. After the addition of quenching agent sodium thiosulfate, total organic chlorine and total organic bromine exhibited a two-phase decomposition pattern with increasing contact time, and a significant decomposition was observed for different types of quenching agents, quenching doses, and pH conditions. More importantly, the decomposed TOX closely correlated with the acute toxicity of quenched water against luminous bacteria, implying that the DBPs responsible for TOX decomposition could be of important toxicological significance. Based on nontarget analysis by using high-resolution mass spectrometry, molecular formulas for the decomposed TOX were determined. After re-examining the mass balance of TOX in the context of unintentional decomposition, it was found that both the level and percentage of unknown TOX in chlorinated waters were considerably higher than historically thought. Overall, this study brings new insights into the knowledge of TOX formed during chlorination, providing important clues on the identification of toxicity driver in drinking water."

This study applied an environmentally extended multiregional input-output model to trace this mismatch and measure the carbon inequality quantitatively within China during 2007-2017. The results show that during the past decade, China's national carbon inequality was continuously worsening with carbon Gini coefficients rising regardless of production-(0.21- 0.30) or consumption-based (0.12-0.18) accounting. The regional carbon inequality was deteriorating, where less developed provinces with 20% of total value-added emitted 32.9% of total CO2 emissions in 2007, while this figure rose to 42.6% in 2017. The eastern provinces (Jiangsu and Shanghai) had entered into net economic and carbon beneficiaries keeping high trade advantages, by contrast the northwest provinces (Ningxia and Xinjiang) were trapped in a lose-lose situation with trade benefits declining by 68%. The southwest provinces (Yunnan and Guangxi) shifted from being net carbon and value-added exporters to net importers, stepping into the earlier development mode of eastern provinces. This hidden and exacerbated carbon inequality calls for regional-specific measures to avoid the dilemma of economic development and CO2 mitigation, which also gives a good reminder for the rising economies, like India."

The thyroid hormone thyroxine (tT4) and the antibody immunoglobulin E (IgE) were associated with mercury and cortisol concentrations interactively, where the magnitude and direction of the association of each biomarker with mercury or cortisol changed depending on the concentration of the other factor. For example, when cortisol concentrations were lowest, tT4 was positively related to muscle mercury, whereas tT4 had a negative relationship with muscle mercury in seals that had the highest cortisol concentrations. Additionally, we observed that two thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (tT3) and reverse triiodothyronine (rT3), were negatively (tT3) and positively (rT3) associated with mercury concentrations and cortisol in an additive manner. As an example, tT3 concentrations in late breeding seals at the median cortisol concentration decreased by 14% across the range of observed muscle mercury concentrations. We also observed that immunoglobulin M (IgM), the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (IL 6), and a reproductive hormone, estradiol, were negatively related to muscle mercury concentrations but were not related to cortisol. Specifically, estradiol concentrations in late molting seals decreased by 50% across the range of muscle mercury concentrations. These results indicate important physiological effects of mercury on free-ranging apex marine predators and interactions between mercury bioaccumulation and extrinsic stressors. Deleterious effects on animals' abilities to maintain homeostasis (thyroid hormones), fight off pathogens and disease (innate and adaptive immune system), and successfully reproduce (endocrine system) can have significant individual-and population-level consequences."

Rather than producing a single fuel product, lignocellulosic biorefineries have the potential to serve as hubs for the production of fuels, production of petrochemical replacements, and treatment of high-moisture organic waste. A detailed techno-economic analysis and life-cycle greenhouse gas assessment are developed to explore the cost and emission impacts of integrated corn stover-to-ethanol biorefineries that incorporate both codigestion of organic wastes and different strategies for utilizing biogas, including onsite energy generation, upgrading to bio-compressed natural gas (bioCNG), conversion to poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) bioplastic, and conversion to single-cell protein (SCP). We find that codigesting manure or a combination of manure and food waste alongside process wastewater can reduce the biorefinery's total costs per metric ton of CO2 equivalent mitigated by half or more. Upgrading biogas to bioCNG is the most cost-effective climate mitigation strategy, while upgrading biogas to PHB or SCP is competitive with combusting biogas onsite."

Owing to its high concentration, transmission range, and absorption efficiency in organisms, inhalation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5)-bound lead (PM2.5-Pb) may cause significant cardiovascular damage. However, the contribution and adverse effects of PM2.5-Pb on workers and residents in non-ferrous metal smelting areas are not fully understood. In this work, the concentration and chemical speciation of PM2.5-Pb were analyzed to determine its pollution characteristics at a typical non-ferrous metal smelting site. A panel study conducted among factory workers revealed that PM2.5-Pb exposure makes an important contribution to the human absorption of Pb. Although the chemical speciation of PM2.5-Pb suggested poor water solubility, a high bioavailability was observed in mice (tissue average value: 50.1%, range: 31.1-71.1%) subjected to inhalation exposure for 8 weeks. Based on the bioavailability data, the relationship between PM2.5-Pb exposure and cardiovascular damage was evaluated in animal simulation experiments. Finally, a damage threshold and cardiovascular-specific risk assessment model were established for the non-ferrous metal smelting area. Our project not only accurately estimates the risk of PM2.5-bound heavy metals on the cardiovascular system but also offers a scientific basis for future prevention and therapy of PM2.5- Pb-related diseases."

Owing to its widespread use, fipronil and its metabolites (fipronil sulfone, fipronil desulfinyl, and fipronil sulfide), termed FPM, can be frequently detected in drinking water and food. Fipronil can affect the thyroid function of animals, but the effects of FPM on the human thyroid remain unclear. We employed human thyroid follicular epithelial Nthy-ori 3-1 cells to examine combined cytotoxic responses, thyroid-related functional proteins including the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), deiodinases I-III (DIO I-III), and the nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway induced by FPM of 1-1000-fold concentrations detected in school drinking water collected from a heavily contaminated area of the Huai River Basin. Thyroid-disrupting effects of FPM were evaluated by examining biomarkers of oxidative stress and thyroid function and tetraiodothyronine (T4) levels secreted by Nthy-ori 3-1 cells after FPM treatment. FPM activated the expression of NRF2, HO-1 (heme oxygenase 1), TPO, DIO I, and DIO II but inhibited NIS expression and increased the T4 level of thyrocytes, indicating that FPM can disrupt the function of human thyrocytes through oxidative pathways. Given the adverse impact of low FPM concentrations on human thyrocytes, supportive evidence from rodent studies, and the critical importance of thyroid hormones on development, the effects of FPM on the neurodevelopment and growth of children warrant priority attention."

However, after a period of high effectiveness, studies have shown possible re-eutrophication and the return of harmful algal blooms. While such abrupt ecological changes were attributed to the internal P loading, the role of lake warming and its potential synergistic effects with internal loading, thus far, has been understudied. Here, in a eutrophic lake in central Germany, we quantified the driving mechanisms of the abrupt re-eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms in 2016 (30 years after the first P precipitation). A process-based lake ecosystem model (GOTM-WET) was established using a high-frequency monitoring data set covering contrasting trophic states. Model analyses suggested that the internal P release accounted for 68% of the cyanobacterial biomass proliferation, while lake warming contributed to 32%, including direct effects via promoting growth (18%) and synergistic effects via intensifying internal P loading (14%). The model further showed that the synergy was attributed to prolonged lake hypolimnion warming and oxygen depletion. Our study unravels the substantial role of lake warming in promoting cyanobacterial blooms in re-eutrophicated lakes. The warming effects on cyanobacteria via promoting internal loading need more attention in lake management, particularly for urban lakes."

However, the dynamic responses of biofilm metabolism during the dry-wet transition remain poorly understood. Herein, the dynamic changes in biofilm metabolic activities were investigated through mesocosm experiments under short-term (25 day) and long-term drought (90 day), followed by a 20 day rewetting. The biofilm ecosystem metabolism, as measured by gross primary production and community respiration, was significantly inhibited and turned heterotrophic during the desiccation phase and then recovered, becoming autotrophic during the rewetting period regardless of the desiccation periods due to the high resilience of the autotrophic community. However, long-term drought decreased the recovery rate of the ecosystem metabolism and also caused irreparable damage to the biofilm carbon metabolism, measured using Biolog Eco Plates. Specifically, the recovery of the total carbon metabolic activity is related to the specific carbon source utilized by biofilm microorganisms, such as polymers, carbohydrates, and carboxylic acids. However, the divergent changes of amino acids caused the failure of the total carbon metabolism in long-term drought treatments to recover to the control level even after 20 days of rewetting. This research provides direct evidence that the increased duration of non-flow periods affects biofilm-mediated carbon biogeochemical processes."

Although much knowledge has been gained regarding the anaerobic degradation of xylene isomers in the past 2 decades, the diversity of those bacteria which are able to degrade them under microaerobic conditions is still unknown. To overcome this limitation, aerobic and microaerobic xylene-degrading enrichment cultures were established using groundwater taken from a xylene-contaminated site, and the associated bacterial communities were investigated using a polyphasic approach. Our results show that the xylene-degrading bacterial communities were distinctly different between aerobic and microaerobic enrichment conditions. Although members of the genus Pseudomonas were the most dominant in both types of enrichments, the Rhodoferax and Azovibrio lineages were only abundant under microaerobic conditions, while Sphingobium entirely replaced them under aerobic conditions. Analysis of a metagenome-assembled genome of a Rhodoferax-related bacterium revealed aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading ability by identifying two catechol 2,3-dioxygenases in the genome. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that both enzymes belonged to a newly defined subfamily of type I.2 extradiol dioxygenases (EDOs). Aerobic and microaerobic xylene-degradation experiments were conducted on strains Sphingobium sp. AS12 and Pseudomonas sp. MAP12, isolated from the aerobic and microaerobic enrichments, respectively. The obtained results, together with the whole-genome sequence data of the strains, confirmed the observation that members of the genus Sphingobium are excellent aromatic hydrocarbon degraders but effective only under clear aerobic conditions. Overall, it was concluded that the observed differences between the bacterial communities of aerobic and microaerobic xylene-degrading enrichments were driven primarily by (i) the method of aromatic ring activation (monooxygenation vs dioxygenation), (ii) the type of EDO enzymes, and (iii) the ability of degraders to respire utilizing nitrate."

Simultaneous determination of phi PPRI values from numerous water samples through existing experimental methods is time consuming and ineffective. Herein, machine learning models were developed with a systematic data set including 1329 data points to predict the values of three phi PPRIs (phi 3DOM*, phi 1O2, and phi center dot OH) based on DOM spectral parameters, experimental conditions, and calculation parameters. The best predictive performances for phi 3DOM*, phi 1O2, and phi center dot OH were achieved using the CatBoost model, which outperformed the traditional linear regression models. The significances of the wavelength range and spectral parameters on the three phi PPRI predictions were revealed, suggesting that DOM with lower molecular weight, lower aromatic content, and a more autochthonous portion possessed higher phi PPRIs. Chain models were constructed by adding the predicted phi 3DOM* as a new feature into the phi 1O2 and phi center dot OH models, which consequently improved the predictive performance of phi 1O2 but worsened the phi center dot OH prediction likely due to the complex formation pathways of center dot OH. Overall, this study offered robust phi PPRI prediction across interlaboratory differences and provided new insights into the relationship between PPRIs formation and DOM properties."

However, the effect of secondary atom incorporation into Fe(III) oxyhydroxides on this process is poorly understood. Here, we show that the presence of oxygen vacancy (OV) as a result of Cu incorporation in goethite substantially enhances the As(III) oxidation by Fe(II) under oxic conditions. Electrochemical and density functional theory (DFT) evidence reveals that the electron transfer (ET) rate constant is enhanced from 0.023 to 0.197 s-1, improving the electron efficiency of the surface-bound Fe(II) on OV defective surfaces. The cascade charge transfer from the surface-bound Fe(II) to O2 mediated by Fe(III) oxyhydroxides leads to the O-O bond of O2 stretching to 1.46-1.48 angstrom equivalent to that of superoxide (center dot O2-), and center dot O2- is the predominant ROS responsible for As(III) oxidation. Our findings highlight the significant role of atom incorporation in changing the ET process on Fe(III) oxyhydroxides for ROS production. Thus, such an effect must be considered when evaluating Fe mineral reactivity toward changing their surface chemistry, such as those noted here for Cu incorporation, which likely determines the fates of arsenic and other redox sensitive pollutants in the environments with oscillating redox conditions."

Remote lakes also have been contaminated by anthropogenic Hg through atmospheric depositions. Long-term sediment-core profiles revealed an approximately 3-fold increase in Hg fluxes to sediments from c. 1850 to 2000. Generalized additive models indicate that c. 3-fold increases in Hg fluxes also occurred since 2000 in the remote sites, while Hg emissions from anthropogenic sources have remained relatively stable. The tropical and subtropical Americas are vulnerable to extreme weather events. Air temperatures in this region have shown a marked increase since the 1990s, and extreme weather events arising from climate change have increased. When comparing Hg fluxes to recent (1950-2016) climatic changes, results show marked increases in Hg fluxes to sediments during dry periods. The Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) time series indicate a tendency toward more extreme drier conditions across the study region since the mid-1990s, suggesting that instabilities in catchment surfaces caused by climate change are responsible for the elevated Hg flux rates. Drier conditions since c. 2000 appear to be promoting Hg fluxes from catchments to lakes, a that will likely be exacerbated under future climate-change scenarios."

Here, we examine how aggregates of goethite (alpha- FeOOH) nanoparticle deposited on 100-300 mu m quartz particles (GagCS) alter the transport of two emerging contaminants and two naturally occurring inorganic ligands-silicates and phosphates. Bromide tracer experiments showed no water fractionation into mobile and immobile water zones in an individual goethite-coated sand (GCS) column, whereas around 10% of the total water was immobile in a GagCS column. Reactive compounds were, in contrast, considerably more mobile and affected by diffusion-limited processes. A new simulation approach coupling the mobile-immobile equation with surface complexation reactions to surface reactive sites suggests that similar to 90% of the binding sites were likely within the intra-aggregate zones, and that the mass transfer between mobile and immobile fractions was the rate-limited step. The diffusion-controlled processes also affected synergetic and competitive binding, which have otherwise been observed for organic and inorganic compounds at goethite surfaces. These results thereby call for more attention on transport studies, where tracer or conservative tests are often used to describe the reactive transport of environmentally relevant molecules."

The risk assessments are generally carried out using the common vole as a focal species with conservative theoretical estimates of external exposure. These are then compared to dose-related toxicity endpoints established in toxicity studies, often with laboratory species. The aim of the present study was to determine the actual internal dosimetry of PPPs' active ingredients (AIs) in a population of common voles to provide the basis for informed higher tier risk assessment. As a proof of concept, two fungicidal AIs (fludioxonil and cyprodinil) were investigated using a range of application methodologies. Individuals were treated using oral gavage application (AI dose: 100/200 mg/kg) and fed treated grass (AI sprayed at 2 kg/ha) under laboratory, semi-natural, and natural conditions. Our results show that demographic factors play a significant role in the individual residue profile and that age structure is a key aspect that determines the overall exposure risk of a population. These results are consistent from laboratory to field conditions. Future approaches could establish dose-residue relationships that are reflective of natural food intake rates in wild common vole populations in the risk assessment of PPPs."

Herein, we used EpiKutis 3D-Human Skin Equivalents (3D-HSE) to quantitatively assess the percutaneous pene-tration of nine LCMs, which were detected in e-waste dismantling workers' hand wipes with high detection frequencies. LCMs with higher log Kow and greater molecular weight (MW) were more difficult to penetrate through the skin. Molecular docking results showed that ABCG2 (an efflux transporter) may be responsible for percutaneous penetration of LCMs. These results suggest that passive diffusion and active efflux transport may be involved in the penetration of LCMs across the skin barrier. Furthermore, the occupational dermal exposure risks evaluated based on the dermal absorption factor suggested the underestimation of the continuous LCMs' health risks via dermal previously."

The food production system is a top contributor to this nitrogen pollution. While the food trade plays a vital role in distancing the environmental impacts of nitrogen use from the consumer, previous work on nitrogen pollution and management in the Bay is yet to carefully consider the effect of embedded nitrogen found in products (nitrogen mass within the product) imported and exported throughout the Bay. Our work advances understanding across this area by creating a mass flow model of nitrogen embedded in the food production chain throughout the Chesapeake Bay Watershed that separates phases of the production and consumption processes for crops, live animals, and animal products and considers commodity trade at each phase by combining aspects of both nitrogen footprint and nitrogen budget models. Also, by tracking nitrogen embedded in products imported and exported in these processes, we distinguished between direct nitrogen pollution and nitrogen pollution externalities (displaced N pollution from other regions) from outside of the Bay. We developed the model for the watershed and all its counties for major agricultural commodities and food products for 4 years 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017 with a specific focus on 2012. Using the developed model, we determined the spatiotemporal drivers of nitrogen loss to the environment from the food chain within the watershed. Recent literature leveraging mass balance approaches has suggested that previous long-term declines in nitrogen surplus and improvements in nutrient use efficiency have stagnated or begun to reverse. Our results suggest that within the Chesapeake Bay, increased corn and wheat acreage and steadily increasing livestock/poultry production may have led to the stagnation in decreasing N loss trends from agricultural production observed over the past two decades. We also show that at the watershed scale, trade has reduced the food chain nitrogen loss by about 40 million metric tons. This model has the potential to quantify the effect of various decision scenarios, including trade, dietary choices, production patterns, and agricultural practices, on the food production chain nitrogen loss at multiple scales. In addition, the model's ability to distinguish between nitrogen loss from local and nonlocal (due to trade) sources makes it a potential tool to optimize regional domestic production and trade to meet local watershed's needs while minimizing the resulting nitrogen loss."

We tested reductive dechlorination of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH), along with CH4 production, in MES systems whose cathodes were coated with conductive magnetite nanoparticles (NaFe), biochar (BC), magnetic biochar (FeBC), or anti-conductive silica biochar (SiBC). Coating with NaFe enriched electroactive microorganisms, boosted electro-bioreduction, and accelerated gamma-HCH dechlorination and CH4 production. In contrast, BC only accelerated dechlorination, while FeBC only accelerated methanogenesis, because of their assemblies of functional taxa that selectively transferred electrons to those electron sinks. SiBC, which decreased electro-bioreduction, yielded the highest CH4 production and increased methanogens and the mcrA gene. This study provides a strategy to selectively control the distribution of electrons between reductive dechlorination and methanogenesis by adding conductive or anti-conductive materials to the MES's cathode. If the goal is to maximize dechlorination and minimize methane generation, then BC is the optimal conductive material. If the goal is to accelerate electro-bioreduction, then the best addition is NaFe. If the goal is to increase the rate of methanogenesis, adding anti-conductive SiBC is the best."

The mass concentrations of total MPs and NPs decreased from 26.23 and 11.28 mu g/L in the influent to 1.75 and 0.71 mu g/L in the effluent, with removal rates of 93.3 and 93.7% in plants A and B, respectively.

An Analysis of Cascading Costs and CO2 Emissions Reduction of Industrial CCS Implementation on the Construction of a Bridge"	"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY"			"English"	"Article; Early Access"						"carbon capture and storage; CO2 reduction; cost-benefit analysis; cost analysis; CO2 emissions"		"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an essential technology to mitigate global CO2 emissions from power and industry sectors. Despite the increasing recognition of its importance to achieve the net-zero target, current CCS deployment is far behind targeted ambitions. A key reason is that CCS is often perceived as too expensive. The costs of CCS have however traditionally been looked at from the industrial plant perspective, which does not necessarily reflect the end user's one. This paper addresses the incomplete view by investigating the impact of implementing CCS in industrial facilities on the overall costs and CO2 emissions of end-user products and services. As an example, we examine the extent to which an increase in costs of raw materials (cement and steel) due to CCS impacts the costs of building a bridge. Results show that although CCS significantly increases cement and steel costs, the subsequent increment in the overall bridge construction cost remains marginal (similar to 1%). This 1% cost increase, however, enables a deep reduction in CO2 emissions (similar to 51%) associated with the bridge construction. Although more research is needed in this area, this work is the first step to a better understanding of the real cost and benefits of CCS."

The dust concentrations of OPAs associated with the increasing economic development and population density from western to eastern China, whereas the NOPE concentration in Northeast China (median, 11,900 ng/g; range, 4360-16,400 ng/g) was the highest. Geographically, the distribution of NOPEs was significantly associated with annual sunshine duration and precipitation at each sampling site. Results of laboratory experiments further revealed that the simulated sunlight irradiation promoted the heterogeneous phototransformation of OPAs in dust, and this process was accelerated with the existence of reactive oxygen species and enhanced relative humidity. Importantly, during this phototransformation, the hydroxylated, hydrolyzed, dealkylated, and methylated products, e.g., bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) methyl phosphate, were identified by nontargeted analysis, part of which were estimated to be more toxic than their parent compounds.

Until now, little is known about the growth and fate of protozoa and their associated bacteria in drinking water systems. In this study, we aim to investigate how drinking water treatment affects the growth and fate of protozoa and their associated bacteria in a subtropical megacity. The results showed that viable protozoa were prevalent in the city's tap water, and amoebae were the major component of tap water protozoa. In addition, protozoan-associated bacteria contained many potential pathogens and were primarily enriched in amoeba hosts. Furthermore, this study showed that current drinking water disinfection methods have little effect on protozoa and their associated bacteria. Besides, ultrafiltration membranes unexpectedly served as an ideal growth surface for amoebae in drinking water systems, and they could significantly promote the growth of amoeba-associated bacteria. In conclusion, this study shows that viable protozoa and their associated bacteria are prevalent in tap water, which may present an emerging health risk in drinking water biosafety."

However, there are few field-based regional studies regarding the POPs released from BB. Due to the current limitations of emission factors and satellites, the contribution of BB to airborne POPs is still not well understood. In this study, with the simultaneous monitoring of BB biomarkers and POPs based on polyurethane foam-based passive air sampling technique, we mapped the contribution of BB to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the Indo-China Peninsula. Spearman correlations between levoglucosan and 16 PCBs (rs = 0.264-0.767, p < 0.05) and 2 OCPs (rs = 0.250-0.328, p < 0.05) confirmed that BB may facilitate POP emissions. Source apportionment indicated that BB contributed 9.3% to the total PCB and OCP mass. The high contribution of positive matrix factorization resolved BB to PCBs and OCPs was almost consistent with their concentration distributions in the open BB season but not completely consistent with those in the pre-monsoon and/or monsoon seasons. Their contribution distributions may reflect the use history and geographic distribution in secondary sources of POPs. The field-based contribution dataset of BB to POPs is significant in improving regional BB emission inventories and model prediction."

When targeted methods are unable to identify the chemicals present, alternative approaches, including non-targeted analysis (NTA) methods, can be used to identify unknown analytes. With new and efficient data processing workflows, it is becoming possible to achieve confident chemical identifications via NTA in a timescale useful for rapid response (typically 24-72 h after sample receipt). To demonstrate the potential usefulness of NTA in rapid response situations, we have designed three mock scenarios that mimic real-world events, including a chemical warfare agent attack, the contamination of a home with illicit drugs, and an accidental industrial spill. Using a novel, focused NTA method that utilizes both existing and new data processing/analysis methods, we have identified the most important chemicals of interest in each of these designed mock scenarios in a rapid manner, correctly assigning structures to more than half of the 17 total features investigated. We have also identified four metrics (speed, confidence, hazard information, and transferability) that successful rapid response analytical methods should address and have discussed our performance for each metric. The results reveal the usefulness of NTA in rapid response scenarios, especially when unknown stressors need timely and confident identification."

Here, based on the bottom-up method, whole-industrial-chain CH4 emission in China (CH4-CHINA) is developed to track CH4 emissions from production to use and finally to disposal. The estimated Chinese national CH4 emissions in 2020 are 39288.3 Gg (25,230.8-53,345.7 Gg), with 50.4 and 49.6% emissions generated from fossil-fuel and food systems, respectively. similar to 130,000 point sources are included to achieve a highly resolved inventory of CH4 emissions, which account for similar to 53.5% of the total anthropogenic CH4 emissions in 2020. Our estimate is 36% lower than the Chinese inventory reported to the UNFCCC and 40% lower than EDGAR v6.0, mainly driven by lower emissions from rice cultivation, waste management, and coal supply chain in this study. Based on the emission flow, we observe that previous studies ignored the emissions from natural gas vehicles and residential appliances, coke production, municipal solid waste predisposal, septic tanks, biogas digesters, and food sewage treatment, which totally contribute similar to 12.4% of the national anthropogenic CH4 emissions. The results discussed in this study provide critical insights to design and formulate effective CH4 emission mitigation strategies."

While benefiting the economy, trade can also exacerbate resource use inequality among regions. Here, we propose telecoupled water withdrawal (TWW) to examine the impact of distant consumption on local water resources, defined as local water withdrawal driven remotely by consumption in other regions. We characterize the TWW in China in 2015 at the city level (350 cities) using a nested multiregional input-output model. We find that approximately 20% of TWW is linked to foreign consumption, more than a quarter of which is driven by the United States. Moreover, cities with high TWW are concentrated on the Southeast coast and in Northwest China. Cities in Xinjiang province (Northwest China) account for 12% of the national TWW but only 0.7% of China's GDP. Our findings shed light on the telecoupling of pressure on local water resources in China cities and distant consumption at the global scale, calling for joint efforts by the contributors and beneficiaries of TWW to ensure the synergistic sustainability of water resources and trade."

However, the spatiotemporal variations of indigenous microbial community and biodehalogenation activity of the background matrix, a fundamental aspect for understanding EK-Bio, remain unclear. To fill this gap, we investigated the variation of trichloroethylene (TCE) biodehalogenation activity in response to indigenous microbial community succession in EK-Bio by both column and batch experiments. For a 195 day EK-Bio column (similar to 1 V/cm, electrolyte circulation, lactate addition), biodehalogenation activity occurred first near the cathode (<60 days) and then spread to the anode (>90 days), which was controlled by electron acceptor (i.e., Fe(III)) competition and microbe succession. Amplicon sequencing and metagenome analysis revealed that iron-reducing bacteria (Geobacter, Anaeromyxobacter, Geothrix) were enriched within initial 60 d and were gradually replaced by organohalide-respiring bacteria (versatile Geobacter and obligate Dehalobacter) afterward. Iron-reducing bacteria required an initial long time to consume the competitive electron acceptors so that an appropriate reductive condition could be developed for the enrichment of organohalide-respiring bacteria and the enhancement of TCE biodehalogenation activity."

Here, a new electron shuttling pathway was found in the EET process by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 with resazurin, a lipophilic electron mediator. With resazurin, the genes encoding outer-membrane cytochromes (mtrCBA and omcA) were downregulated. Although cytochrome deletion substantially reduced biocurrent generation to 1-12% of that of wild-type (WT) cells, the presence of resazurin restored biocurrent generation to 168 mu A center dot cm-2 (Delta mtrA/ omcA/mtrC), nearly equivalent to that of WT cells (194 mu A center dot cm-2), indicating that resazurin-mediated electron transfer was not dependent on the Mtr pathway. Biocurrent generation by resazurin was much lower in Delta cymA and Delta mtrA/omcA/mtrC/fccA/cctA mutants (4 and 6 mu A center dot cm-2) than in WT cells, indicating a key role of FccA, CctA, and CymA in this process. The effectiveness of resazurin in EET of Mtr cytochrome mutants is also supported by cyclic voltammetry, resazurin reduction kinetics, and in situ c-type cytochrome spectroscopy results. The findings demonstrated that low molecular weight, lipophilic electron acceptors, such as phenoxazine and phenazine, may facilitate electron transfer directly from periplasmic and inner membrane proteins, thus providing new insight into the roles of exogenous electron mediators in electron shuttling in natural and engineered biogeochemical systems."

Herein, we demonstrate that quenching is an effective strategy for preparing defect-rich Pt/metal oxide catalysts with superior catalytic oxidation activity. As a proof of concept, quenching of alpha-Fe2O3 in aqueous Pt(NO3)2 solution yielded a catalyst containing Pt single atoms and clusters over defect-rich alpha- Fe2O3 (Pt/Fe2O3-Q), which possessed state-of-the-art activity for toluene oxidation. Structural and spectroscopic analyses established that the quenching process created abundant lattice defects and lattice dislocations in the alpha-Fe2O3 support, and stronger electronic interactions between Pt species and Fe2O3 promote the generation of higher oxidation Pt species to modulate the adsorption/desorption behavior of reactants. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) characterization studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations determined that molecular oxygen and Fe2O3 lattice oxygen were both activated on the Pt/Fe2O3-Q catalyst. Pt/CoMn2O4, Pt/ MnO2, and Pt/LaFeO3 catalysts synthesized by the quenching method also offered superior catalytic activity for toluene oxidation. Results encourage the wider use of quenching for the preparation of highly active oxidation catalysts."

During this process, a simultaneous decontamination and carbon recovery can be achieved with minimal use of PDS, which is significantly different from conventional degradation processes. The feasibility of this process is demonstrated by eight kinds of typical organic pollutants and by a real coking wastewater. For the treatment of the selected pollutants, 30.2-91.9% DOC abatement was achieved with 24.8-91.2% carbon recovery; meanwhile, only 5.2-47.0% of PDS was consumed compared to a conventional degradation process. For the treatment of a real coking wastewater, 71.0% DOC abatement was achieved with 66.0% carbon recovery. With phenol as a representative compound, our polymerization-based heat/PDS process is applicable in a wide pH range (3.5-9.0) with a carbon recovery of >87%. Both SO4 center dot- and HO center dot can be initiators for polymerization, with different contribution ratios under various conditions. Phenol monomers are semioxidized to form phenolic radicals, which are polymerized via chain transfer or chain growth processes to form separable solid phenol polymers, benzenediol polymers, and cross-linked polymers."

In this study, we report continuous measurements of atmospheric O2 in downtown Lanzhou, an industrial metropolis in northwestern China. We found declines in atmospheric O2 associated with deteriorated air quality and robust anticorrelations between O2 and gaseous oxides. By combining O2 and pollutants measurements with a Lagrangian atmospheric transport model, we quantitatively break down urban respiration (Delta O2URB) into human respiration (Delta O2RES) and fossil fuel combustion (Delta O2FF). We found increased Delta O2FF contribution (from 66.92% to 72.50%) and decreased Delta O2RES contribution (from 33.08 to 27.50%) as O2 declines and pollutants accumulate. Further attribution of Delta O2FF reveals intracity transport of atmospheric pollutants from industrial sectors and suggests transportation sectors as the major O2 sink in downtown Lanzhou. The varying relationships between O2 and pollutants under different conditions unfold the dynamics of urban respiration and provide insights into the O2 and energy consumption, pollutant emission, and intracity atmospheric transport processes."

In this paper, the light-absorbing properties and molecular compositions of lipid-soluble organic components in fine particulate matter of Beijing from 2016 to 2018, characterized by an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer and gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry, respectively, were combined to untargetedly screen the key BrC molecules by a partial least squares regression model for the first time. A total of 421 molecules were obtained, where 61 molecules were identified qualitatively and 22 molecules quantitatively. To the best of our knowledge, 11 molecules were newly identified BrC species. These qualitative molecules included polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with higher ambient concentrations and mass absorbing efficiencies (MAEs), as well as oxygen-and nitrogen-containing aromatic components with relatively lower concentrations and MAEs. The absorption contribution at 365 nm of quantified BrC species to lipid-soluble BrC during heating seasons was 39.1 +/- 17.0%, which was about 5 times as high as previous studies. These results help establish a complete BrC molecular database and provide data support for better evaluating the climate effect of atmospheric carbonaceous aerosols and formulating air pollution control strategies."

Using organophosphate esters (OPEs) as an example, this study attempted to integrate physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)based forward dosimetry and in vitro bioassays to assess the likelihood of contaminants inducing biological effects in humans. The total exposure level of OPEs for Chinese residents was 19.5 +/- 8.71 ng/kg/day with inhalation being the main exposure pathway. Then, human PBPK models were developed for individual OPEs to predict their steady-state concentrations in human tissues, and the predicted median levels in blood were close to the measurements. The reference doses (RfDs) of OPEs based on in vitro bioassays were comparable to in vivo animal derived RfDs, demonstrating the reliability of in vitro bioassays. Therefore, the likelihood of OPEs inducing bioactivities in humans (RQin-vitro) was calculated using in vitro toxicity data and OPE levels in human tissues. The RQin-vitros of tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate, tris(1,3dichloropropyl) phosphate, and triphenyl phosphate (7.68 x 10-5-3.18 x 10-3) were comparable to the risks assessed using traditional RfDs (5.22 x 10-5-1.94 x 10-3), indicating the credibility of the method proposed in this study. This study establishes a new framework to improve the health risk assessment of contaminants without sufficient toxicity data and minimize the need for animal experimentation."

However, the kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of SO2 by NO2 on the surface of complex particles remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically explore the mechanism and kinetics of the reaction between SO2 and NO2 on diesel black carbon (DBC) under light irradiation. The experimental results prove that DBC photochemistry can not only significantly promote the heterogeneous reduction of NO2 to produce HONO via transferring photoinduced electrons but also indirectly promote OH radical formation. These reduction products of NO2 as well as NO2 itself greatly promote the heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 on DBC. NO2 oxidation, HONO oxidation, and the surface photo-oxidation process are proven to be three major surface oxidation pathways of SO2. The kinetics results indicate that the surface photooxidation pathway accounts for the majority of the total SO2 uptake (similar to 63%), followed by the HONO oxidation pathway (similar to 27%) and direct oxidation by NO2 (similar to 10%). This work highlights the significant synergistic roles of DBC, NO2, and light irradiation in enhancing the atmospheric oxidation capacity and promoting the heterogeneous formation of sulfate."

We developed an advanced technique for pNACs and measured 1764 compounds in atmospheric fine particulate matter sampled in urban Beijing, China. Molecular formulas were derived for 433 compounds, of which 17 were confirmed using reference standards. Potential novel species with up to four aromatic rings and a maximum of five functional groups were found. Higher concentrations were detected in the heating season, with a median of 82.6 ng m-3 for sigma 17pNACs. Non-negative matrix factorization analysis indicated that primary emissions particularly coal combustion were dominant in the heating season. While in the non-heating season, aqueous-phase nitration could generate abundant pNACs with the carboxyl group, which was confirmed by their significant association with the aerosol liquid water content. Aqueous-phase formation of 3-and 5-nitrosalicylic acids instead of their isomer of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzoic acid suggests the existence of an intermediate where the intramolecular hydrogen bond favors kinetics-controlled NO2 center dot nitration. This study provides not only a promising technique for the pNAC measurement but also evidence for their atmospheric aqueous-phase formation, facilitating further evaluation of pNACs' climatic effects."

However, their pristine (sp2 C-C) regions usually restack into impermeable channels as a result of van der Waals interactions, resulting in a much low permeance. In this study, we demonstrate that the restacked regions could be electrochemically expanded to form ultrafast water transport nanochannels by providing a low positive potential (e.g., +1.00 V vs SCE) to the rGO membrane. Experimental investigations indicate that the structural expansion is attributed to the intercalation of water molecules into the restacked regions, driven by hydrogen bond interactions between water molecules and hydroxyl groups that are electrochemically produced on edges of rGO nanosheets. The structural expansion could be promoted by weakening the graphene-OH- interactions through intermittent application of the potential. As a result of more ultrafast water transport nanochannels available, the electrochemically treated rGO membranes could have a permeance 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the pristine one and similar to 3 times higher than that of graphene oxide membranes. Because of their smaller average pore size, the rGO membranes also have a higher ionic/molecular rejection performance than graphene oxide membranes."

It has been suggested that the magnitude of OC preservation is constrained by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limitation in response to climate and anthropogenic changes. However, little is known about the connection of soil OC with N-P and their forms in response to allochthonous inputs in BCEs. By analyzing soil OC, N, and P densities of BCEs from 797 sites globally, we find that, in China, where allochthonous OC provides 50- 75% of total OC, soil C/P and N/P ratios are 4-to 8-fold lower than their global means, and 23%, 29%, and 20% of buried OC, N, and P are oxidation-resistant fractions that linked with minerals. We estimate that the OC stocks in China should double over the next 40 years under high allochthonous inputs and elevated N/P ratio scenarios during BCE restoration. Allochthonous-dominated BCEs thus have the capacity to enhance refractory and mineral bound organic matter accumulation. Protection and restoration of such BCEs will provide long-term mitigating benefits against sea level rise and greenhouse gas emissions."

Understanding the role of reactive species using probes and quenchers is one of the main requirements for good process design. However, much fundamental kinetic data for the reactions of probes and quenchers with reactive species is lacking, probably leading to inappropriate probe and quencher selection and dosing. In this work, second order rate constants for over 150 reactions of probes and quenchers with reactive species such as center dot OH, SO4 center dot-, and Cl center dot and chemical oxidants such as free chlorine and persulfate were determined. Some previously ill-quantified reactions (e.g., furfuryl alcohol and methyl phenyl sulfoxide reactions with certain chemical oxidants, nitrobenzene and 1,4-dioxane reactions with certain halogen radicals) were found to be kinetically favorable. The selection of specific probes can be guided by the improved kinetic database. The criteria for properly choosing dosages of probes and quenchers were proposed along with a procedure for quantifying reactive species free of interference from probe addition. The limitations of probe and quencher approaches were explicated, and possible solutions (e.g., the combination with other tools) were proposed. Overall, the kinetic database and protocols provided in this work benefit future research in understanding the radical chemistry in AOPs as well as other radical-involved"	"[Lei, Yu; Yu, Yafei; Lei, Xin; Liang, Xi; Cheng, ShuangShuang; Yang, Xin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Environm Pollut Control & R, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Chem, Key Lab Photochem, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Ouyang, Gangfeng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Chem, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China"	"Sun Yat Sen University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Chemistry, CAS; Sun Yat Sen University"	"Yang, X (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Environm Pollut Control & R, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China."

The comprehensive data set presented here should not be used for annualization, however shows the potential of what could be achieved with a larger sample size in terms of potential methane reduction and improving inventory accuracy. Among the benefits in obtaining data with this level of granularity is the possibility to compare the emissions of similar FEs on different plants including FEs present in both liquefaction and regasification facilities. Emissions from noncontinuous sources and superemitters can also be identified and quantified enabling more accurate inventory reporting and targeted maintenance and repair.

Our study incorporates spatial and temporal data to quantify concentrations of inorganic (bromide (Br-), iodide (I-), and iodate (IO3-)), organic, and total bromine (BrT) and iodine (IT) species from 286 drinking water sources and 7 wastewater effluents across the United States. Br- ranged from <5-7800 mu g/L (median of 62 mu g/L in surface water (SW) and 95 mu g/L in groundwater (GW)). I-was detected in 41% of SW (1-72 mu g/L, median = <1 mu g/L) and 62% of GW (<1-250 mu g/L, median = 3 mu g/L) samples. The median Br-/I- ratio in SW and GW was 22 mu g/mu g and 16 mu g/mu g, respectively, in paired samples with detect Br- and I-. BrT existed primarily as Br-, while IT was present as I-, IO3 -, and/or total organic iodine (TOI). Inorganic iodine species (I- and IO3-) were predominant in GW samples, accounting for 60-100% of IT; however, they contributed to only 20-50% of IT in SW samples. The unknown fraction of IT was attributed to TOI. In lakes, seasonal cycling of I-species was observed and was presumably due to algal productivity. Finally, Spearman Rank Correlation tests revealed a strong correlation between Br- and IT in SW (RBr-,IT = 0.83) following the log10 (Br-, mu g/L) = 0.65 x log10 (IT, mu g/L) - 0.17 relationship.

In this study, concentrations of six parent NEOs (p-NEOs) and N-desmethyl-acetamiprid (Ndm-ACE) were measured in urine and whole blood samples from infants, in addition to breast milk, infant formula, and tap water collected in South China. The p-NEO with the highest median concentration in urine (0.25 ng/mL) and blood (1.30) samples was dinotefuran (DIN), while imidacloprid (IMI) was abundant in breast milk (median: 0.27 ng/mL), infant formula (0.22), and tap water (0.028). The older infants (181-360 days) might face higher NEO and N-dm-ACE exposure than younger infants (0-180 days). Blood samples contained a significantly (p < 0.01) higher median concentration of Sigma(6)p-NEOs (2.03 ng/mL) than that of urine samples (0.41), similar to acetamiprid (ACE), IMI, thiacloprid (THD), DIN, and N-dm-ACE, suggesting that NEOs readily partition into blood. Furthermore, breast-fed infants tend to have higher exposure levels than formula-fed infants. Infant formula prepared with tap water augmented the daily intake of Sigma NEOs. The external sources contributed 80% of the total dose to IMI and clothianidin (CLO) exposure, while other unknown sources contributed to ACE, THD, and DIN exposure in infants.

However, whether and how 6PPD-Q could be formed during the aging of TWPs in soils remains poorly understood. Here, we examine the accumulation and formation mechanisms of 6PPD-Q during the aging of TWPs in soils. Our results showed that biodegradation predominated the fate of 6PPD-Q in soils, whereas anaerobic flooded conditions were conducive to the 6PPD-Q formation and thus resulted in a -3.8-fold higher accumulation of 6PPD-Q in flooded soils than wet soils after aging of 60 days. The 6PPD-Q formation in flooded soils was enhanced by Fe reduction-coupled 6PPD oxidation in the first 30 days, while the transformation of TWP-harbored environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) to superoxide radicals (O2 center dot-) under anaerobic flooded conditions further dominated the formation of 6PPD-Q in the next 30 days.

Herein, we report substantial performance enhancement of ammonium generation on Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, Ti, and W oxide-based cathodes upon reconstruction. Among them, the performance of a freestanding ER-Co3O4-x/CF (Co3O4 grown on Co foil subjected to electrochemical reduction) cathode was superior to its unreconstructed counterpart and other cathodes; e.g., an ammonium yield of 0.46 mmol h-1 cm-2, an ammonium selectivity of 100%, and a Faradaic efficiency of 99.9% were attained at -1.3 V in a 1400 mg L-1 NO3--N solution. The reconstruction behaviors were found to vary with the underlying substrate. The inert carbon cloth only acted as a supporting matrix for immobilizing Co3O4, without appreciable electronic interactions between them. A combination of physicochemical characterizations and theoretical modeling provided compelling evidence that the CF-promoted self-reconstruction of Co3O4 induced the evolution of metallic Co and the creation of oxygen vacancies, which promoted and optimized interfacial nitrate adsorption and water dissociation, thus boosting the ENRR performance. The ER-Co3O4-x/CF cathode performed well over wide ranges of pH and applied current and at high nitrate loadings, ensuring its high efficacy in treating high-strength real wastewater."

However, the co-adsorption behavior and sorption sites of multiple contaminants in different-sized pores remain unclear. Herein, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) approach is performed to investigate the adsorption mechanism of toluene and cetane in the confined space of carbon at the molecular level. The ring current effect induces the variation in the NMR chemical shifts of in-pore adsorbed toluene and cetane, realizing the identification of pore-dependent adsorption sites for contaminant removal. Cetane has a slower adsorption kinetic but a higher binding energy than toluene, which could squeeze toluene from micropores to larger pores with increasing adsorption quantity. This leads to a stronger competitive adsorption effect in small micropores than in mesopores. Accordingly, hierarchical porous carbons are determined to be the most effective adsorbents for the adsorption of coexisting contaminants. This study not only provides an effective NMR method to reveal the adsorption mechanism in the confined space of porous carbon at the molecular level but also offers new insights into the pore size-dependent adsorption of activated carbon for petroleum contaminant treatment."

In addition to carbonate, nitrate has been correlated to uranium groundwater concentrations in two major U.S. aquifers. However, to date, direct evidence that nitrate mobilizes naturally occurring U from aquifer sediments has not been presented. Here, we demonstrate that the influx of high-nitrate porewater through High Plains alluvial aquifer silt sediments bearing naturally occurring U(IV) can stimulate a nitrate-reducing microbial community capable of catalyzing the oxidation and mobilization of U into the porewater. Microbial reduction of nitrate yielded nitrite, a reactive intermediate, which was further demonstrated to abiotically mobilize U from the reduced alluvial aquifer sediments. These results indicate that microbial activity, specifically nitrate reduction to nitrite, is one mechanism driving U mobilization from aquifer sediments in addition to previously described bicarbonate-driven desorption from mineral surfaces, such as Fe(III) oxides."

Bleach generates toxic species including hypochlorous acid (HOCl), chlorine (Cl2), and chloramines. Their reaction with organic species can generate additional toxic compounds. To understand interactions between masks and bleach disinfection, bleach was injected into a ventilated chamber containing a manikin with a breathing system and wearing a surgical or KN95 mask. Concentrations inside the chamber and behind the mask were measured by a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) and a Vocus proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (Vocus PTRMS). HOCl, Cl2, and chloramines were observed during disinfection and concentrations inside the chamber are 2-20 times greater than those behind the mask, driven by losses to the mask surface. After bleach injection, many species decay more slowly behind the mask by a factor of 0.5-0.7 as they desorb or form on the mask. Mass transfer modeling confirms the transition of the mask from a sink during disinfection to a source persisting >4 h after disinfection. Humidifying the mask increases reactive formation of chloramines, likely related to uptake of ammonia and HOCl. These experiments indicate that masks are a source of chemical exposure after cleaning events occur."

Seawater use for toilet flushing and district cooling systems is reportedly practical for achieving multiaspect benefits in Hong Kong. However, the currently followed practices are yet to be systematically evaluated for scale expansions and system adaptation in other coastal cities. The significance of using seawater to enhance local water-energy securities and carbon mitigations in urban areas remains unknown. Herein, we developed a high-resolution scheme to quantify the effects of the large-scale urban use of seawater on a city's reliance on non-local and non-natural water and energy supplies and its carbon mitigation goals. We applied the developed scheme in Hong Kong, Jeddah, and Miami to assess diverse climates and urban characteristics. The annual water and energy saving potentials were found to be 16-28% and 3-11% of the annual freshwater and electricity consumption, respectively. Life cycle carbon mitigations were accomplished in the compact cities of Hong Kong and Miami (2.3 and 4.6% of the cities' mitigation goals, respectively) but not in a sprawled city like Jeddah. Moreover, our results suggest that district-level decisions could result in optimal outcomes supporting seawater use in urban areas."

Herein, the potential disrupting effects and underlying binding mechanism of 14 wastewater-derived aliphatic and aromatic DBPs and 12 other substances on Chinese rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) transthyretin (CrmTTR) were tested and revealed by in vitro and in silico methods. The amino acid sequences of CrmTTR were determined, and the recombinant CrmTTR with a molecular mass of 66.3 kDa was expressed and purified. In vitro assay results indicated that eight selected aromatic DBPs exhibited detectable CrmTTR disrupting ability. Meanwhile, six aliphatic DBPs were not CrmTTR binders. Molecular modeling results implied that hydrophobic hydrogen bonds and/or ionic pair interactions were non-negligible. Four binary classification models with high classification performance were constructed. A significant positive linear relationship was observed for the binding affinity data from CrmTTR and human TTR (n = 18, r = 0.922, p < 0.0001). However, the binding affinity for 13 out of 18 tested compounds with CrmTTR was higher than that with human TTR.

To address these challenges, fast pyrolysis of the algae pellet in molten NaOH-Na2CO3 was conducted at 550, 650, and 750 degrees C. Algae were chosen as feedstock for their high photosynthetic efficiency and growth rate, and the concept of coupling molten salt with concentrated solar energy was proposed to address the issue of high energy consumption at high temperatures. At 750 degrees C, the pollutant gases containing Cl and S were completely removed, and the HCN removal rate reached 44.92%. During the continuous pyrolysis process, after a slight increase, the hydrogen yield remained stable at 71.48 mmol/g-algae and constituted 86.10% of the gas products, and a minimum theoretical hydrogen production efficiency of algae can reach 84.86%. Most importantly, the evolution of physicochemical properties of molten NaOH-Na2CO3 was revealed for the first time. Combined with the conversion characteristics of feedstock and gas products, this study provides practical guidance for large-scale application of molten salt including feedstock, operation parameters, and post-treatment process."

Here we employed the complexes of Fe(III) with the biodegradable picolinic acid (PICA) to activate PMS for degradation of selected chlorinated phenols, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, herbicides, and industrial compounds at pH 4.0- 6.0. The FeIII-PICA complexes greatly outperformed the ligand-free Fe(III) and other Fe(III) complexes of common aminopolycarboxylate ligands. In the main activation pathway, the key intermediate is a peroxymonosulfate complex, tentatively identified as PICA-FeIII- OOSO3 -, which undergoes O-O homolysis or reacts with FeIII- PICA and PMS to yield FeIV=O and SO4 center dot- without the involvement of commonly invoked Fe(II). PICA-FeIII-OOSO3- can also react directly with certain compounds (chlorophenols and sulfamethoxazole). The relative contributions of PICA-FeIII-OOSO3-, FeIV=O, and SO4 center dot- depend on the structure of target compounds. This work sets an eligible example to enhance the reactivity of Fe(III) toward PMS activation by ligands and sheds light on the previously unrecognized role of the metal-PMS complexes in directing the catalytic cycle and decontamination as well."

Since their superior redox property mainly arises from the synergistic effect between Cu and the CeO2 support, the dispersion state of Cu species may dominate the catalytic performance of Cu/CeO2 catalysts: the extremely high or low dispersity is disadvantageous for the catalytic performance. The nanoparticle catalysts usually present few contact sites, while the single-atom catalysts tend to be passivated due to their relatively single valence state. To achieve a suitable dispersion state, we synthesized a superior Cu/CeO2 catalyst with Cu atomic clusters, realizing high atomic exposure and unit atomic activity simultaneously via favorable electron interaction and an anchoring effect. The catalyst reaches a 90% CO conversion at 130 degrees C, comparable to noble-metal catalysts. According to combined in situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, the superior CO oxidation performance of the Cu atomic cluster catalyst results from the joint efforts of effective adsorption of CO at the electrophilic sites, the CO spillover phenomenon, and the efficient bicarbonate pathway triggered by hydroxyl. By providing a superior atomic cluster catalyst and uncovering the catalytic oxidation mechanism of Cu-Ce dual-active sites, our work may enlighten future research on industrial gaseous pollutant removal."

Multiple studies have strengthened our understanding of the global emission of TEs, despite attention being mainly focused on Hg and source classification in different studies showing large discrepancies. In contrast to those of developed countries and regions, the officially published emission inventory is still lacking in developing countries, despite the fact that studies on evaluating the emissions of TEs on a national scale or one specific source category have been numerous in recent years. Additionally, emissions of TEs emitted from waste incineration and traffic-related sources have produced growing concern with worldwide rapid urbanization. Although several studies attempt to estimate the emissions of TEs based on PM emissions and its source-specific chemical profiles, the emission factor approach is still the universal method. We call for more extensive and in-depth studies to establish a precise localization national emission inventory of TEs based on adequate field measurements and comprehensive investigation to reduce uncertainty."

However, little is known about the warming effect on the bioaccumulation of PFAS in aquatic organisms. In this study, the pelagic organisms Daphnia magna and zebrafish, and the benthic organism Chironomus plumosus were exposed to 13 PFAS in a sediment-water system with a known amount of each PFAS at different temperatures (16, 20, and 24 degrees C). The results showed that the steady-state body burden (Cb-ss) of PFAS in pelagic organisms increased with increasing temperatures, mainly attributed to increased water concentrations. The uptake rate constant (ku) and elimination rate constant (ke) in pelagic organisms increased with increasing temperature. In contrast, warming did not significantly change or even mitigate Cb-ss of PFAS in the benthic organism Chironomus plumosus, except for PFPeA and PFHpA, which was consistent with declined sediment concentrations. The mitigation could be explained by the decreased bioaccumulation factor due to a more significant percent increase in ke than ku, especially for long-chain PFAS. This study suggests that the warming effect on the PFAS concentration varies among different media, which should be considered for their ecological risk assessment under climate change."

However, the knowledge of which atmospheric vapors can enhance IA-induced NPF remains limited. The unique halogen bond (XB)-forming capacity of IA makes it difficult to evaluate the enhancing potential (EP) of target compounds on IAinduced NPF based on widely studied sulfuric acid systems. Herein, we employed a three-step procedure to evaluate the EP of potential atmospheric nucleation precursors on IA-induced NPF. First, we evaluated the EP of 63 precursors by simulating the formation free energies (Delta G) of the IA-containing dimer clusters. Among all dimer clusters, 44 contained XBs, demonstrating that XBs are frequently formed. Based on the calculated Delta G values, a quantitative structure-activity relationship model was developed for evaluating the EP of other precursors. Second, amines and O/S-atom-containing acids were found to have high EP, with diethylamine (DEA) yielding the highest potential to enhance IA-induced nucleation by combining both the calculated Delta G and atmospheric concentration of considered 63 precursors. Finally, by studying larger (IA)1-3(DEA)1-3 clusters, we found that the IADEA system with merely 0.1 ppt (2.5x106 cm-3) DEA yields comparable nucleation rates to that of the IA-iodous acid system."

In contrast to most studies based on small datasets and library searches, this study developed and compared four machine learning-based classifiers and two large-scale blended plastic datasets, where a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), decision tree, and random forest (RF) were fed with raw spectral data from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, while a 2D CNN used the corresponding spectral images as the input. With an overall accuracy of 96.43% on a small dataset and 97.44% on a large dataset, the 1D CNN outperformed other models. The 1D CNN was the best at predicting environment samples, while the RF was the most robust with less spectral data. Overall, RF and 2D CNNs might be evaluated for plastic identification with fewer spectral data; however, 1D CNNs were thought to be the most effective with sufficient spectral data. Accordingly, an open-source MP spectroscopic analysis tool was developed to facilitate a quick and accurate analysis of existing MP samples."

However, the relative influence of each component of PM2.5 on health risk is poorly understood. In a cohort study in the contiguous United States between 2000 and 2017, we examined the effect of long-term exposure to PM2.5 main components and allcause mortality in older adults who had to be at least 65 years old and enrolled in Medicare. We estimated the yearly mean concentrations of six key PM2.5 compounds, including black carbon (BC), organic matter (OM), soil dust (DUST), nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), and ammonium (NH4+), using two independently sourced well-validated prediction models. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the hazard ratios for mortality and penalized splines for assessing potential nonlinear concentration-response associations. Results suggested that increased exposure to PM2.5 mass and its six main constituents were significantly linked to elevated all-cause mortality. All components showed linear concentration-response relationships in the low exposure concentration ranges. Our research indicates that long-term exposure to PM2.5 mass and its essential compounds are strongly connected to increased mortality risk. Reductions of fossil fuel burning may yield significant air quality and public health benefit."

Magnesium sulfite is spawned along with the desulfurization process in coal-fired power plants, which is usually disposed of as solid waste. Here, a waste control by waste method was proposed upon the redox of Cr(VI)-sulfite, in which highly toxic Cr(VI) is detoxicated and sequent enriched on a novel biocharinduced cobalt-based silica composite (BISC) due to the forced electron transfer from chromium to surface hydroxyl. The immobilized Cr on BISC gave rise to the reconstruction of catalytic active sites Cr-O-Co, which further enhance its performance in sulfite oxidation by elevating O2 adsorption. As a result, the sulfite oxidation rate increased by 10 times compared with the non-catalysis benchmark together with the maximum chromium adsorption capacity being 120.3 mg/g. Therefore, this study provides a promising strategy to simultaneously control highly toxic Cr(VI) and sulfite, achieving high-grade sulfur resource recovery for wet magnesia desulfurization."

In the breathing-simulation experiment, no notable differences were found in the total number of particles among mask types or between breathing intensities. However, when considering subranges, <2.5 mu m particles accounted for similar to 90% of the total number of micro/nanoparticles.

Health hazards posed by CPs in curtains are poorly understood. Here, chamber tests and an indoor fugacity model were used to predict CP emissions from soft poly(vinyl chloride) curtains, and dermal uptake through direct contact was assessed using surface wipes. Short-chain and medium -chain CPs accounted for 30% by weight of the curtains. Evaporation drives CP migration, like for other semivolatile organic plasticizers, at room temperature. The CP emission rate to air was 7.09 ng/(cm2 h), and the estimated short-chain and medium-chain CP concentrations were 583 and 95.3 ng/m3 in indoor air 21.2 and 172 mu g/g in dust, respectively. Curtains could be important indoor sources of CPs to dust and air. The calculated total daily CP intakes from air and dust were 165 ng/(kg day) for an adult and 514 ng/(kg day) for a toddler, and an assessment of dermal intake through direct contact indicated that touching just once could increase intake by 274 mu g. The results indicated that curtains, which are common in houses, could pose considerable health risks through inhalation of and dermal contact with CPs."

In this study, the sources, fractionation, and migration of PFASs were compared in the greenhouse and open-field soils of the Fen-Wei Plain, China. The total concentrations of PFASs (sigma 17PFAS) were comparable in the greenhouse and open-field soils but with different profiles. Detrended correspondence and correlation analyses indicated that dry deposition was an important source of PFASs in the open-field soils, whereas surface water had a notable contribution to the greenhouse soils due to more frequent irrigation. The PFASs in the soils were mainly present in water-soluble fraction (F1). The F1 proportions of short-chain and long-chain PFASs were negatively correlated with the anion exchange capacity (AEC) and organic carbon content (foc) in soil, respectively, with that of short-chain PFASs being higher than long-chain ones. The AEC was significantly higher while foc was lower in the greenhouse soil than the open-field soil, leading to lower proportions of F1 for short-chain PFASs while higher for long-chain ones in the greenhouse soil. Frequent irrigation and elevated temperatures promoted the migration of PFASs in greenhouse soil; thus, the sigma 17PFAS and F1 exhibited an increasing trend with soil depth."

This is particularly concerning during adolescence when adipocytes expand rapidly. Herein, we sought to understand how exposure to PCB mixtures found in U.S. schools affects human adipose mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) health and function. We investigated how exposure to Aroclor 1016 and Aroclor 1254, as well as a newly characterized non-Aroclor mixture that resembles the PCB profile found in cabinets, Cabinet Mixture, affects adipose MSC growth, viability, and function in vitro. We found that exposure to all three mixtures resulted in two distinct types of toxicity. At PCB concentrations > 20 mu M, the majority of MSCs die, while at 1-10 mu M, MSCs remained viable but display numerous alterations to their phenotype. At these sublethal concentrations, the MSC rate of expansion slowed and morphology changed. Further assessment revealed that PCB-exposed MSCs had impaired adipogenesis and a modest decrease in immunosuppressive capabilities. Thus, exposure to PCB mixtures found in schools negatively impacts the health and function of adipose MSCs. This work has implications for human health due to MSCs' role in supporting the growth and maintenance of adipose tissue.

However, epidemiological evidence for legacy PFAS is inconclusive, and for alternative PFAS, it is little known. In this investigation, we selected 718 mother-child pairs from the Chinese Maoming Birth Cohort Study and measured 17 legacy and alternative PFAS in the third-trimester serum. Neuropsychological developments (communication, gross motor function, fine motor function, problem solving ability, and personal-social skills) were assessed at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months using the Ages and Stages Questionnaires 3rd edition. Trajectories of each subscale were classified into persistently low and persistently high groups via group-based trajectory modeling. Logistic regression and grouped weighted quantile sum were fitted to assess the potential effects of individual PFAS and their mixtures, respectively. Higher linear PFHxS levels were associated with elevated odds for the persistently low trajectories of communication (OR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.66) and problem solving ability (OR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.14, 3.90). Similar findings were observed for linear PFOS, 1m-PFOS, PFDA, PFDoDA, PFUnDA, and legacy PFAS mixture. However, no association was observed for alternative PFAS and their mixture. We provided insights into the longitudinal links between prenatal legacy/alternative PFAS exposure and neuropsychological development trajectories over the first 3 years of life."

Biomass combustion is one of the most important anthropogenic sources of mercury (Hg) emissions in the TP. However, due to the lack of knowledge about Hg emission characteristics and activity levels in the plateau, atmospheric Hg emissions from biomass combustion in the TP are under large uncertainties. Here, based on pilot-scale experiments, we found that particle-bound mercury (PBM; mean of 83.1???87.7 ng/m3) occupied 17.93??? 49.31% of the total emitted Hg and the PBM ??202Hg values (average ???1.65%0 to ???0.77%0) were significantly higher than those of the corresponding feeding biomass. The ??200Hg values of total gaseous mercury and PBM were more negative (???0.08%0 to ???0.05%0) than other anthropogenic emissions, providing unique isotopic fingerprints for this sector. Together with the investigated local activity levels, Hg emissions from biomass combustion reached 402 ?? 74 kg/a, which were dozens of times higher than previous estimates. The emissions were characterized by conspicuous spatial heterogeneity, concentrated in the northern and central TP. Specialized Hg emissions and the Hg isotope fingerprint of local biomass combustion can aid in evaluating the influence of this sector on the fragile ecosystems of the TP."

Enteroviruses infect multiple host cells via various entry routes, and each entry route may be impaired differently by a given disinfectant. Yet, it is unknown how the choice of host cells affects the observed inactivation kinetics. Here, we evaluated the inactivation kinetics of echovirus 11 (E11) by free chlorine, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and heat, using three different host cells (BGMK, RD, and A549). Inactivation rates were independent of the host cell for treatment of E11 by UV or heat. Conversely, E11 inactivation by free chlorine occurred 2-fold faster when enumerated on BGMK cells compared with RD and A549 cells. Host cell-dependent inactivation kinetics by free chlorine were also observed for echovirus 7, 9, and 13, and coxsackievirus A9. E11 inactivation by free chlorine was partly caused by a loss in host cell attachment, which was most pronounced for BGMK cells. BGMK cells lack the attachment receptor CD55 and a key subunit of the uncoating receptor beta 2M, which may contribute to the differential inactivation kinetics for this cell type. Consequently, inactivation kinetics of enteroviruses should be assessed using host cells with different receptor profiles."

Here, we evaluated the impacts of winter heating and clean heating polices on air quality in China using a novel, observation-based causal inference approach. During 2015-2021, winter heating causally increased annual PM2.5, daily maximum 8-h average O3, and SO2 by 4.6, 2.5, and 2.3 mu g m-3, respectively. From 2015 to 2021, the impacts of winter heating on PM2.5 in Beijing and surrounding cities (i.e., 2 + 26 cities) decreased by 5.9 mu g m-3 (41.3%), whereas that in other northern cities only decreased by 1.2 mu g m-3 (12.9%). This demonstrates the effectiveness of stricter clean heating policies on PM2.5 in 2 + 26 cities. Overall, clean heating policies caused the annual PM2.5 in mainland China to reduce by 1.9 mu g m-3 from 2015 to 2021, potentially avoiding 23,556 premature deaths in 2021."

Polyhalogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PXDD/Fs) are typical toxic POPs, and the formation mechanisms of PXDD/Fs are better understood than the mechanisms through which other POPs form. In this study, a framework for identifying detailed PXDD/Fs formation mechanisms was developed and reviewed. The latest laboratory studies in which organic free radical intermediates of PXDD/Fs have been detected in situ and isotope labeling methods have been used to trace transformation pathways were reviewed. These studies provided direct evidence for PXDD/Fs formation pathways. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to determine the rationality of proposed PXDD/Fs formation pathways involving different elementary reactions. Many field studies have been performed, and the PXDD/Fs congener patterns found were compared with PXDD/Fs congener patterns obtained in laboratory simulation studies and theoretical studies to mutually verify the dominant PXDD/Fs formation mechanisms. The integrated method involving laboratory simulation studies, theoretical calculations, and field studies described and reviewed here can be used to clarify the mechanisms involved in PXDD/Fs formation. This review brings together information about PXDD/Fs formation mechanisms and provides a methodological framework for investigating PXDD/Fs and other POPs formation mechanisms during combustion processes, which will help in the development of strategies for controlling POPs emissions."

However, this reaction remains controversial due to lack of direct evidence and poorly understood mechanisms. In this study, we show that As(III) oxidation can be facilitated by Fe oxyhydroxides (i.e., goethite) under anoxic conditions coupled with the reduction of structural Fe(III). An excellent electron balance between As(V) production and Fe(III) reduction is obtained. The formation of an active metastable Fe(III) phase at the defective surface of goethite due to atom exchange is responsible for the oxidation of As(III). Furthermore, the presence of defects (i.e., Fe vacancies) in goethite can noticeably enhance the electron transfer (ET) and atom exchange between the surface-bound Fe(II) and the structural Fe(III) resulting in a two time increase in As(III) oxidation. Atom exchange-induced regeneration of active goethite sites is likely to facilitate As(III) coordination and ET with structural Fe(III) based on electrochemical analysis and theoretical calculations showing that this reaction pathway is thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. Our findings highlight the synergetic effects of defects in the Fe crystal structure and Fe(II)-induced catalytic processes on anoxic As(III) oxidation, shedding a new light on As risk management in soils and subsurface environments."

This process of immunometabolism plays a critical role in the regulation of immune cell function. Triclosan, a synthetic antibacterial component present in a wide range of consumer items, has been shown to cause immunotoxicity in a number of organisms. However, it is unclear whether and how triclosan impacts immunometabolism. Here, human macrophages were used as model cells to explore the modulatory effect of triclosan on immunometabolism. Untargeted metabolomics using integrated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed that triclosan changed the global metabolic profile of macrophages. Furthermore, Seahorse energy analysis and 13C isotope-based metabolic flux analysis revealed that triclosan decreased mitochondrial respiratory activity and promoted a metabolic transition from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Triclosan also polarizes macrophages to the proinflammatory M1 phenotype and activates the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is consistent with triclosan-induced metabolic phenotypic modifications. Collectively, these findings showed that triclosan exposure at micromolar concentrations caused metabolic reprogramming in macrophages, which triggered an inflammatory response. These findings are important for understanding the immunotoxicity caused by triclosan, which is necessary for determining the risk posed by triclosan in the environment."

Herein, we show that surface water and well water were frequently used by >147 million rural residents living in low-income inland and mountainous areas. Driven by socioeconomic development and government intervention, the level of access to tap water in rural China increased to 70% by 2017. Nevertheless, the rate was considerably lower than that in cities and unevenly distributed across the country. Approximately 90% of drinking water was boiled, an increase from 85% a decade ago. The contribution of electricity, mainly electric kettles, to the boiling of water was 69%. Similar to cooking, living conditions and heating requirements are the main influencing indicators of energy used to boil water. In addition to socioeconomic development, government intervention is a key factor driving the transition to safe water sources, universal access to tap water, and clean energy. Further improvement in drinking water safety in poor and remote rural areas remains challenging, and more intervention and more investment are needed."

Therefore, we investigated the photodegradation trends of PET base fabrics with PU coating (PET-U) as a representative of composite plastics. Attention was paid to the comparison of the photoaging process of PET-U with that of pure PET base fabric (PET-P). To reveal the potential for chain scission, physical and chemical changes (e.g., surface morphology, molecular weight, and crystallinity) of the two fabrics were explored. The generation of microplastic fibers (MPFs) and microplastic particles (MPPs) was distinguished. Compared with PET-P, PET-U showed a similar but delayed trend in various characteristics and debris release rate as the photoaging time prolonged. Even so, after 360 h of illumination, the generated number of MPs (including MPFs and MPPs) rose considerably to 9.32 x 10(7) MPs/g, and the amount of released nanoplastics (NPs) increased to 2.70 x 10(11) NPs/g from PET-U. The suppression of MP formation from PET-U was potentially directed by the physical shielding of the upper PU layer and the dropped MPs, which resisted the photochemical radical effect. The components of dissolved organic matter derived from plastics (P-DOM) were separated by molecular weight using a size-exclusion chromatography-diode array detector-organic carbon detector/organic nitrogen detector (SEC-DAD-OCD/ OND), and the results showed that a larger amount of carbon- and nitrogen-containing chemical substances were generated in PETU, accompanied by more aromatic and fluorescent compounds. The results provided theoretical bases and insights for future research on the risks of plastic debris from PU synthetic leathers on aquatic organisms and indicated feasible directions for exploring combined pollution studies of plastics."

Levels, profiles, and spatial distribution of the detected PFAS were found to be distinctly site-specific and influenced by the area's historic function, production structure of the plant, downpour-induced accidental pollution, and variations in the adsorption and transport of compounds. Very high concentrations of PFAS [mainly C4 and C8 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs)] were found in topsoil and groundwater from both plants, with the highest values of 4.89 x 106 mu g/kg dw and 1.10 x 104 mu g/L, respectively. Elevated concentrations of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in this study were attributed to their unintentional formation during the electrochemical fluorination process, which might be an overlooked source of PFCA. PFAS generally showed decreasing trends from shallow layers to the bottom of the soil core and demonstrated some downward migrations at different soil depths with time, and C4-C8 PFAS presented a deeper seepage than their long-chain homologues. Total organic carbon appeared to be more important for PFAS sorption to the topsoil than to the soil core. Workers were at potential risk of exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid via soil at production and storage related sites. This study provides a critical reference for the systematic control of PFAS pollution around manufacturing facilities and a proof for an overlooked source of PFCA."

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) encompasses organic carbon in aquatic systems, yet knowledge about DOM variation throughout the river???lake aquatic continuum within alpine regions is limited. We used optical spectroscopy, ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrom-etry (Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrom-etry), and stable water isotopic measurements to evaluate linkages between DOM composition and hydrological connection. We investigated glacial influences on DOM composition throughout the watershed of Selin Co, including upstream glacier-fed rivers and downstream-linked lakes. We found that the dissolved organic carbon concentration increased, whereas specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA254) decreased along the river???lake continuum. Relative to rivers, the downstream lakes had low relative abundances of polyphenolic and condensed aromatic compounds and humic-like substances but increased relative abundances of aliphatics and protein-like compounds. SUVA254 decreased while protein -like components increased with enriched stable water isotope ??2H-H2O, indicating that DOM aromaticity declined while autochthonous production increased along the flow paths. Glacier meltwater contributed to elevated relative abundances of aliphatic and protein-like compounds in headwater streams, while increased relative abundances of aromatics and humic-like DOM were found in glacier-fed lakes than downstream lakes. We conclude that changes in hydrological conditions, including glacier melt driven by a warming climate, will significantly alter DOM composition and potentially their biogeochemical function in surface waters on the Tibetan Plateau."

Here, we validated an external cycling route of HONO and NOx, i.e., formation of HONO resulting from precursors other than NOx, in the background atmosphere. A chemical budget closure experiment of HONO and NOx was conducted at a background site on the Tibetan Plateau and provided direct evidence of the external cycling. An external daytime HONO source of 100 pptv h-1 was determined. Both soil emissions and photolysis of nitrate on ambient surfaces constituted likely candidate mechanisms characterizing this external source. The external source dominated the chemical production of NOx with HONO as an intermediate tracer. The OH production was doubled as a result of the external cycling. A high HONO/NOx ratio (0.31 +/- 0.06) during the daytime was deduced as a sufficient condition for the external cycling. Literature review suggested the prevalence of high HONO/NOx ratios in various background environments, e.g., polar regions, pristine mountains, and forests. Our analysis validates the prevalence of external cycling in general background atmosphere and highlights the promotional role of external cycling regarding the atmospheric oxidative capacity."

However, chlorinated byproducts [e.g., polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs)] formed during the commercial manufacturing processes and present in organochlorine products are rarely reported. The knowledge on the occurrences and fate of unintentional persistent organic chemicals in the manufacturing of organochlorine chemical is necessary for accurate assessment of the risks of commercial chemicals and their production. Here, PCDD/Fs were tracked throughout chlorobenzene and chloroethylene production processes (from raw materials to final products) by target analysis. Other byproducts that can further transform into PCDD/Fs were also identified by performing non-target screening. As a result, the PCDD/F concentrations were mostly the highest in bottom residues, and the octachlorinated congeners were dominant. Alkali/water washing stages may cause the formation of oxygen-containing byproducts including PCDD/Fs and acyl-containing compounds, so more attention should be paid to these stages. PCDD/Fs were of 0.17 and 0.21-1.2 ng/mL in monochlorobenzene and chloroethylene products, respectively. Annual PCDD/F emissions (17 g toxic equivalent in 2018) during chlorobenzene and chloroethylene production were estimated using PCDD/F emission factors. The results can contribute to the improvement of PCDD/F inventories for the analyzed commercial chemicals."

How Mt stoichiometry affects its sulfidation processes and products remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that xstru is a master variable controlling the rates and extents of sulfide oxidation by magnetite nanoparticles (11 +/- 2 nm). At pH = 7.0-8.0 and the initial Fe/S molar ratio of 10-50, the partially oxidized magnetite (xstru = 0.19-0.43) can oxidize dissolved sulfide to elemental sulfur (S0), but only surface adsorption of sulfide, without interfacial electron transfer (IET), occurs on the nearly stoichiometric magnetite (xstru = 0.47). The higher initial rate and extent of sulfide oxidation and S0 production are observed with the more oxidized magnetite that has the higher electron accepting capability from surface-complexed sulfide (S(-II)(s)). The FeS clusters formed from magnetite sulfidation can be oxidized by the most oxidized magnetite with xstru = 0.19 but not by other magnetite particles. A linear relationship between the Gibbs free energy of reaction and the surface area normalized initial rate of sulfide oxidation is observed in all experiments under the different conditions, suggesting the S(-II)(s)- magnetite IET dominates magnetite sulfidation at high Fe/S molar ratios and near-neutral pH."

While existing studies have suggested that vehicular exhaust is an important source of HCHO, the operating condition-based diesel truck HCHO emission measurements remain severely limited due to the limited temporal resolution and accuracy of measurement techniques. In this study, we characterized the second-by-second HCHO emissions from 29 light-duty diesel trucks (LDDTs) in China over dynamometer and real-world driving tests using a portable online HCHO emission measurement system (PEMS-HCHO), considering various operating conditions. Our results suggested that the HCHO emissions from LDDTs might be underestimated by the widely used offline DNPH-HPLC method. The HCHO emissions at a 200 s cold start from China V LDDT can be up to 50 mg/start. Different driving conditions over dynamometer and real-world driving tests led to a 2-4 times difference in the HCHO emission factors (EFs). Under real-world hot -running conditions, the HCHO EFs of China III, IV, V, and VI LDDTs were 43.5 +/- 35.7, 10.6 +/- 14.2, 8.8 +/- 5.1, and 3.2 +/- 1.2 mg/ km, respectively, which significantly exceeded the latest California low emission vehicle III HCHO emission standard (2.5 mg/km). These findings highlighted the significant impact of vehicle operating conditions on HCHO emissions and the urgency of regulating HCHO emissions from LDDTs in China."

However, the geographical distribution, potential metabolic function, and engineering significance of vAMGs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) remain to be explored. Here, 752 single-contig viral genomes with high confidence, 510 of which belonged to Caudovirales, were recovered from the activated sludge metagenomes of 32 geographically distributed WWTPs. A total of 101 vAMGs involved in various metabolic pathways were identified, the most common of which were the queuosine biosynthesis genes folE, queD, and queE and the sulfur metabolism gene cysH. Phylogenetic analysis and virus-host relationship prediction revealed the probable evolutionary histories of vAMGs involved in carbon (acpP and prsA), nitrogen (amoC), sulfur (cysH), and phosphate (phoH) metabolism, which potentially mediate microbial carbon and nutrient cycling. Notably, 11 of the 38 (28.3%) vAMGs identified in the metagenomes with corresponding metatranscriptomes were transcriptionally expressed, implying an active functional state. This meta-analysis provides the first broad catalog of vAMGs in municipal WWTPs and how they may assist in the basic physiological reactions of their microbial hosts or nutrient cycling in the WWTPs, and therefore, may have important effects on the engineering of wastewater treatment processes."

We aimed to explore the associations of 10 urinary phthalate metabolites (mPAEs), either as individuals or as a mixture, with thyroid function indicators [free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine (FT3), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)] in 144 children aged 4-12 years with up to 3 repeated visits across 3 seasons. Significant and positive associations were observed for mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) with TSH, as well as monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) with FT3 in dose-response manners. The relationship between MEHP and TSH remained robust in multiple-phthalate models. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models revealed overall linear associations of the 10 mPAE mixture with higher TSH and FT3 levels, and MEHP and MBzP were major contributors. Meanwhile, MEHP, MiBP, and MnBP were linked to the elevation of multiple cytokines including CCL 27, CCL3, CXCL1, and IL-16. Among them, IL-16 mediated the relationships of MEHP and MiBP with TSH, and the mediated proportions were 24.16% and 24.27%, respectively. Our findings suggested that mPAEs dominated by MEHP were dose-responsively associated with elevated TSH among healthy children and mediated by IL-16."

A time-stratified case-crossover study was performed among 20,867 AMI patients from 46 hospitals in Shanghai, China, between January 2015 and December 2020. Hourly data of AMI onset and number concentrations of nanoparticles of multiple size ranges below 0.10 mu m (0.01-0.10, UFP/PNC0.01-0.10; 0.01-0.03, PNC0.01-0.03; 0.03-0.05, PNC0.03-0.05; and 0.05-0.10 mu m, PNC0.05-0.10) were collected. Conditional logistic regressions were applied. Transient exposures to these nanoparticles were significantly associated with AMI onset, with almost linear exposure-response curves. These associations occurred immediately after exposure, lasted for approximately 6 h, and attenuated to be null thereafter. Each interquartile range increase in concentrations of total UFPs, PNC0.01-0.03, PNC0.03-0.05, and PNC0.05-0.10 during the preceding 0-6 h was associated with increments of 3.29, 2.08, 2.47, and 2.93% in AMI onset risk, respectively. The associations were stronger during warm season and at high temperatures and were robust after adjusting for criteria air pollutants. Our findings provide novel evidence that hourly UFP exposure is associated with immediate increase in AMI onset risk."

Here, we identified the dominant role of paleo-geomorphology driven by paleo-climate in controlling the spatial variability of geogenic ammonium in groundwater using random forest algorithm and revealed the underlying mechanisms based on borehole sediment analysis of data obtained from the Dongting Lake Plain of the central Yangtze River basins in China. In the paleochannel (PC) area, the aquifer depth-matched sediments were deposited during the last deglaciation when warm climate resulted in rapid filling into incised valleys, and terrestrial organic matter (OM) mainly as lignin experienced less degradation prior to sedimentation and had lower humification, higher N abundance, and nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC). In the paleo-interfluve (PI) area, the depth-matched sediments were deposited during the last glaciation, followed by intensive erosion in the surface during the last glacial maximum, and terrestrial OM mainly as lignin had been partly degraded into aliphatics prior to sedimentation and had higher humification, lower N abundance, and NOSC. As a result, under the present anaerobic conditions, less-humic and N-rich OM with more oxidized C tends to be more intensively mineralized into ammonium in the PC area than those in the PI area. These findings highlight the importance of paleo-geomorphology with paleo-climate in controlling the enrichment of geogenic ammonium in groundwater, which has a universal significance for understanding the genesis and distribution of high N loads in the aquatic environment worldwide."

However, the underlying mechanism is not yet fully illustrated. We provide a novel insight to address this from interactions between sediment P and nitrification through monthly field investigations including 204 samples and microcosm experiments in Lake Chaohu. Total N to P mass ratios (TN/TP) varied significantly across seasons especially during algal bloom in summer, with the average value being 26.1 in June and descending to 7.8 in September gradually, triggering dominant cyanobacterial succession from Microcystis to Dolicho-spermum. The regulation effect of sediment N/P on water column TN/TP was stronger in summer than in other seasons. Iron-bound P and alkaline phosphatase activity in sediment, rather than ammonium, contributed to the higher part of nitrification. Furthermore, our microcosm experiments confirmed that soluble active P and enzymatic hydrolysis of organic P, accumulating during algal bloom, fueled nitrifiers and nitrification in sediments. These processes promoted lake N removal and led to relative N deficiency in turn. Our results highlight that N and P cycles do not exist independently but rather interact with each other during lake eutrophication, supporting the dual N and P reduction program to mitigate eutrophication in shallow eutrophic lakes."

However, the low efficiency of electrocatalytic NO3- reduction to NH3 on traditional Cu-based catalysts hinders their practical application. Here, we prepare a Au/Cu single atom (SA) alloy (Au/Cu SAA) that shows a high performance of NH3 synthesis with 99.69% Faradaic efficiency at -0.80 V vs RHE. The structures of Au SAs and alloyed Au/Cu are confirmed by the detailed characterizations. Online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry confirms the occurrence of key reaction intermediates (*NO2, *NO, and *NH3). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that Au SAs efficiently reduce the adsorption energy of *NO3-, and the newly formed Au-Cu bonds boost the reduction process of *NO2 to *NO. Meanwhile, Au/Cu SAAs produce significantly less N2 and N2O byproducts due to the prohibition of N-N coupling on single atoms, which finally leads to excellent Faradaic efficiency and NH3 selectivity."

Increasing the efficacy of silver-based antimicrobial materials will reduce operating costs. Herein, we show that mechanical abrading causes atomization of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) into atomically dispersed Ag (AgSAs) on the surfaces of an oxide-mineral support, which eventually boosts the antibacterial efficacy considerably. This approach is straightfor-ward, scalable, and applicable to a wide range of oxide-mineral supports; additionally, it does not require any chemical additives and operates under ambient conditions. The obtained AgSAs-loaded gamma-Al2O3 inactivated Escherichia coli (E. coli) five times as fast as the original AgNPs-loaded gamma-Al2O3. It can be utilized over 10 runs with minimal efficiency loss. The structural characterizations indicate that AgSAs exhibit a nominal charge of 0 and are anchored at the doubly bridging OH on the gamma-Al2O3 surfaces. Mechanism studies demonstrate that AgSAs, like AgNPs, damage bacterial cell wall integrity, but they release Ag+ and superoxide substantially faster. This work not only provides a simple method for manufacturing AgSAs-based materials but also shows that AgSAs have better antibacterial properties than the AgNPs counterpart."

The mechanism of uptake behavior of different-sized PtNPs and their association with PtNPs-induced phytotoxicity to plants remains unclear. The present study investigated PtNP uptake mechanisms and phytotoxicity simulta-neously to further understand the accumulation and transformation dynamics. The uptake mechanisms were investigated by comparing the uptake and toxicological effects of three different-sized PtNPs (25, 50, and 70 nm) on rice seedlings across an experimental concentration gradient (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/L) during germination. The quantitative and qualitative results indicated that 70 nm-sized PtNPs were more efficiently transferred in rice roots. The increase in the PtNP concentration restricted the particle uptake. Particle aggregation was common in plant cells and tended to dissolve on root surfaces. Notably, the dissolution of small particles was simultaneous with the growth of larger particles after PtNPs entered the rice tissues. Ionomic results revealed that PtNP accumulation induced element homeostasis in the shoot ionome. We observed a significant positive correlation between the PtNP concentration and Fe and B accumulation in rice shoots. Compared to particle size, the exposure concentration of PtNPs had a stronger effect on the shoot ionomic response. Our study provides better understanding of the correlation of ionomic change and NP quantitative accumulation induced by PtNPs in rice seedlings."

In contrast to iodate formation in radionuclide contaminated groundwater by the iodine-oxidizing bacteria, microbial contribution to the formation of high level of iodide in geogenic high iodine groundwater is poorly understood. In this study, our results of comparative metagenomic analyses of deep groundwater with typical high iodide concentrations in the North China Plain revealed the existence of putative dissimilatory iodate-reducing idrABP1P2 gene clusters in groundwater. Heterologous expression and characterization of an identified idrABP1P2 gene cluster confirmed its functional role in iodate reduction. Thus, microbial dissimilatory iodate reduction could contribute to iodide formation in geogenic high iodine groundwater. In addition, the identified iron-reducing, sulfur-reducing, sulfur-oxidizing, and dehalogenating bacteria in the groundwater could contribute to the release and production of iodide through the reductive dissolution of iron minerals, abiotic iodate reduction of derived ferrous iron and sulfide, and dehalogenation of organic iodine, respectively.

The Illumina MiSeq sequencing consequence explained that the denitrifying bacteria with facultative denitrification, iron oxidation, and iron reduction function were located in the dominant species niches in the IACA reactors (e.g., Pseudomonas, Leptothrix, and Comamonas). The diversity and richness of the denitrifying bacterial communities were enhanced in the IACA reactors. Network analysis indicated that aerobic denitrifying bacterial consortia in IACA reactors presented a more complicated co-occurrence structure. The IACA reactors presented the potential for long-term denitrification operation. This study affords a pathway to utilize IACA, promoting aerobic denitrification during low C/N micropolluted water body treatment."

That means even with the same total abatement targets, different abatement allocation strategies across emission sources can have distinct health benefits. Insufficient knowledge of various sources' contributions to health burdens in China, the country suffering substantial PM2.5-related deaths, hindered the government from seeking optimized abatement allocation strategies. In this context, we separated the contributions of 155 emission sources (31 provinces x 5 sectors) to PM2.5-related mortality across China in 2017 by coupling the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx), Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF), and health impact assessment model. We further identified the priority-control emission sources and quantified interprovincial ecological compensation volumes to alleviate inequality induced by emission allocation strategies. Results showed that PM2.5 pollution caused 899,443 excess deaths and around 127 billion USD costs in 2017. Approximately half of the deaths and costs were attributable to emissions from sources outside the boundary of the regions where the deaths occurred. Twenty-five out of 155 emission sources that contributed to the top 60% mortality burdens and had high marginal abatement efficiencies in China shall be the priority-control emission sources. A 1 mu g/m3 decrease of PM2.5 concentration in regions where these key emission sources occur shall be compensated by 76-153 million USD in their receptor regions. Our study sheds light on the sources' contributions to mortality burdens and costs and provides scientific evidence for optimizing the emission allocation and compensation strategies in China. It also has wide implications for other countries suffering similar problems."

However, there are significant knowledge gaps in understanding the spatial distribution and source contribution of Hg in the surface soil of the QTP and factors influencing Hg accumulation. In this study, we comprehensively investigated Hg concentrations and isotopic signatures in the QTP to address these knowledge gaps. Results show that the average Hg concentration in the surface soil ranks as follows: forest (53.9 +/- 36.9 ng g-1) > meadow (30.7 +/- 14.3 ng g-1) > steppe (24.5 +/- 16.1 ng g-1) > shrub (21.0 +/- 11.6 ng g-1). Hg isotopic mass mixing and structural equation models demonstrate that vegetation mediated atmospheric Hg0 deposition dominates the Hg source in the surface soil, with an average contribution of 62 +/- 12% in forests, followed by 51 +/- 10% in shrub, 50 +/- 13% in steppe, and 45 +/- 11% in meadow. Additionally, geogenic sources contribute 28-37% of surface soil Hg accumulation, and atmospheric Hg2+ inputs contribute 10-18% among the four types of biomes. The Hg pool in 0-10 cm surface soil over the QTP is estimated as 8200 +/- 3292 Mg.

Here, the lethality, developmental toxicity, locomotor behavior, and estrogenic activity of BPTMC at different concentrations (0.25-2000 mu g/L) in marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) embryos were examined. In addition, the in silico binding potentials of O. melastigma estrogen receptors (omEsrs) with BPTMC were assessed by docking study. Low-concentration BPTMC exposure (including an environmentally relevant concentration, 0.25 mu g/L) resulted in stimulating effects, including hatching rate, heart rate, malformation rate, and swimming velocity. However, elevated concentrations of BPTMC led to an inflammatory response, changed heart rate and swimming velocity in the embryos and larvae. In the meantime, BPTMC (including 0.25 mu g/L) altered the concentrations of estrogen receptor, vitellogenin, and endogenous 17 beta-estradiol as well as the transcriptional levels of estrogen responsive genes in the embryos or/and larvae. Furthermore, elaborate tertiary structures of omEsrs were built by ab initio modeling, and BPTMC exerted potent binding potential with three omEsrs with -47.23, -49.23, and -50.30 kJ/mol for Esr1, Esr2a, and Esr2b, respectively.

However, many fundamental details about the nature of the active sites and desulfurization mechanism still remain unclear. Here, we reported the experimental and theoretical identifications of active sites in FGD on carbon catalysts. Temperature-programmed decomposition allowed us to modulate the number of oxygen functional groups on carbon catalysts and to establish its correlation with desulfurization activity. Selective passivation further demonstrated that the ketonic carbonyl (C=O) groups are the intrinsic active sites for FGD reaction. Combined with transient response experiments, quasi-in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory simulations, it was revealed that desulfurization reaction on carbon catalysts mainly proceeded via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, during which the nucleophilic ketonic C=O groups served as active sites for chemically absorbing SO2 and their adjacent sp2-hybridized carbon atoms dissociatively activated O2. It also turned out that the formation of H2SO4 is the reaction barrier step. The output of this study should not only advance the understanding of desulfurization at the atomic scale but also provide a general guideline for the rational design of efficient carbon catalysts for FGD."

A variety of fuels burned in different facilities expectedly have distinct impacts on climate, which remains to be quantitatively assessed. This study uses updated emission inventories and an earth system model to evaluate absolute and relative contributions in combustion emission-associated climate forcing by fuels, sectors, and regions. We showed that, from 1970 to 2014, coal burned in the energy sector and oil used in the transportation sector contributed comparable energies consumed (24 and 20% of the total) but had distinct climate forcing (1 and 40%, respectively). Globally, coal burned for energy production had negative impacts on climate forcing but positive effects in the residential sector. In many developing countries, coal combustion in the energy sector had negative radiative forcing (RF) per unit energy consumed due to insufficient controls on sulfur and scattering aerosol levels, but oils in the transportation sector had high positive RF values. These results had important implications on the energy transition and emission reduction actions in response to climate change.

Tissue and subcellular-level behavioral differences between alternative and legacy PFAS were compared via an electron probe microanalyzer with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EPMA-EDS) and differential centrifugation. Our results show that ferns can accumulate PFAS from water, immobilize them in roots, and store them in harvestable tissue. The PFAS loading in roots was dominated by PFOS; however, a substantial amount of associated PFOS could be rinsed off by methanol. Correlation analyses indicated that root length, surface and project area, surface area per unit length of the root system, and molecular size and hydrophobicity of PFAS were the most significant factors affecting the magnitude of root uptake and upward translocation. EPMA-EDS images together with exposure experiments suggested that long-chain hydrophobic compounds tend to be adsorbed and retained on the root epidermis, while short-chain compounds are absorbed and quickly translocated upward. Our findings demonstrated the feasibility of using ferns in phytostabilization and phytoextraction initiatives of PFAS in the future."

Here we developed a method to quantify the toxicity risk of particulate metals, and proposed a way to calculate modifying factors (MFs) for setting site-specific criteria in turbid waters. Specifically, we used a side-by-side experimental design to study copper (Cu) bioaccumulation and toxicity in an estuarine clam, Potamocorbula laevis, under the exposure to dissolved only and dissolved + particulate 65Cu. A toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic model (TK-TD) was used to quantify the processes of Cu uptake, ingestion, assimilation, egestion, and elimination, and to relate mortality risk to tissue Cu. We find that particulate Cu contributes 40-67% of the Cu bioaccumulation when the suspended particulate matter (SPM) ranges from 12 to 229 mg L-1. The Cu-bearing SPM also increases the sensitivity of organisms to internalized Cu by decreasing the internal threshold concentration (CIT) from 141 to 76.8 mu g g-1. MFs were derived based on the TK-TD model to consider the contribution of particulate Cu (in the studied SPM range) for increasing Cu bioaccumulation (MF = 1.3-2.2) and toxicity (MF = 2.3-3.9). Water quality criteria derived from dissolved metal exposure need to be lowered by dividing by an MF to provide adequate protection. Overall, the method we developed provides a scientifically sound framework to manage the risks of metals in turbid waters."

The resulting societal challenges of the Anthropocene (e.g., climate change and impacts, renewable energy, adaptive infrastructure, disasters, pandemics, food insecurity, and biodiversity loss) are complex and systemic, with causes, interactions, and consequences that cascade across a globally connected system of systems. In this Critical Review, we turn to our origin story for insight, briefly tracing the formation of the Universe and the Earth, the emergence of life, the evolution of multicellular organisms, mammals, primates, and humans, as well as the more recent societal transitions involving agriculture, urbanization, industrialization, and computerization. Focusing on the evolution of the Earth, genetic evolution, the evolution of the brain, and cultural evolution, which includes technological evolution, we identify a nested evolutionary sequence of geophysical, biophysical, sociocultural, and sociotechnical systems, emphasizing the causal mechanisms that first formed, and then transformed, Earth systems into Anthropocene systems. Describing how the Anthropocene systems coevolved, and briefly illustrating how the ensuing societal challenges became tightly integrated across multiple spatial, temporal, and organizational scales, we conclude by proposing an evolutionary, system-of-systems, convergence paradigm for the entire family of interdependent societal challenges of the Anthropocene."

This study systematically investigated the stability of iodate, selenite, and selenate coprecipitated with barite via leaching tests. These oxyanions were gradually leached from the oxyanionbearing barite into ultrapure water over time. Leaching of the oxyanions significantly increased in leaching solutions containing NaCl (pH 5.3), NaNO3 (pH 5.9), and Na2SO4 (pH 5.7). Conversely, leaching of the oxyanions was suppressed in KH2PO4 solution (pH 8.5), indicating that phosphate stabilized the oxyanion-bearing barite. The effect of phosphate treatment on oxyanion-bearing barite was further investigated. The results showed that the barite surface was modified with phosphate, and a thin surface layer of a barium phosphate-like structure was formed. The amount of oxyanions leached from the phosphate-treated samples into leaching solutions containing NaCl or NaNO3 was much lower than the amounts leached from the untreated barite samples into ultrapure water. The barite coprecipitation combined with subsequent phosphate treatment may be a promising method to efficiently remove iodate, selenite, and selenate from wastewater and stabilize them as barite coprecipitates."

Additionally, six 24 h composite samples were taken from the influent and effluent of the Leipzig wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) during the snow melt event. 207 compounds were at least detected once (concentrations between 0.80 ng/L and 75 mu g/L). Consistent patterns of traffic-related compounds dominated the chemical profile (58 compounds in concentrations from 1.3 ng/L to 75 mu g/L) and among them were 2benzothiazole sulfonic acid and 1-cyclohexyl-3-phenylurea from tire wear and denatonium used as a bittern in vehicle fluids. Besides, the analysis unveiled the presence of the rubber additive 6-PPD and its transformation product N- (1.3-dimethylbutyl)-N '-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone (6-PPDQ) at concentrations known to cause acute toxicity in sensitive fish species. The analysis also detected 149 other compounds such as food additives, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides. Several biocides were identified as major risk contributors, with a more site-specific occurrence, to acute toxic risks to algae (five samples) and invertebrates (six samples). Ametryn, flumioxazin, and 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester are the main compounds contributing to toxic risk for algae, while etofenprox and bendiocarb are found as the main contributors for crustacean risk. Correlations between concentrations in the WWTP influent and flow rate allowed us to discriminate compounds with snow melt and urban runoff as major sources from other compounds with other dominant sources. Removal rates in the WWTP showed that some traffic-related compounds were largely eliminated (removal rate higher than 80%) during wastewater treatment and among them was 6-PPDQ, while others persisted in the WWTP."

Previous studies on air pollution control have focused on emission reduction demand in China but ignored the influence of transboundary pollution, which has been proven to have a significant impact on air quality in China. Here, we develop an emission-concentration response surface model coupled with transboundary pollution to quantify the emission reduction demand for China to achieve WHO AQG. China cannot achieve WHO AQG by its own emission reduction for high transboundary pollution of both PM2.5 and O3. Reducing transboundary pollution will loosen the reduction demand for NH3 and VOCs emissions in China. However, to meet 10 mu g center dot m-3 for PM2.5 and 60 mu g center dot m-3 for peak season O3, China still needs to reduce its emissions of SO2, NOx, NH3, VOCs, and primary PM2.5 by more than 95, 95, 76, 62, and 96% respectively, on the basis of 2015. We highlight that both extreme emission reduction in China and great efforts in addressing transboundary air pollution are crucial to reach WHO AQG."

A size exclusion chromatography system paired with absorbance, fluorescence, and total organic carbon detection was used to determine the fluorescence quantum yield (phi f) as a function of the apparent molecular weight (AMW). Size-based fractions of each isolate were collected and irradiated to measure singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yield (phi 1O2). phi f decreased with ozonation in low AMW fractions, while increasing in high AMW fractions. phi 1O2 increased with ozone dose in low AMW fractions from similar to 2 to similar to 7% and similar to 3 to similar to 11% for PLFA and SRFA, respectively, indicating that these are the most photoreactive fractions of DOM. Decreases in phi f and concomitant increases in phi 1O2 in low AMW fractions indicated that chemical transformations occurred, likely including the conversion of phenols to quinones, particularly in SRFA. Results further suggest that the photoactive and fluorescent fractions of DOM are likely independent pools of chromophores from different AMW fractions. In PLFA, a linear response in phi 1O2, specific UV absorbance at wavelength 254 nm (SUVA254), and phi f with ozonation indicated the equal distribution of ozone-reactive moieties."

Conversely, orthophosphate can also transform ZnO NPs and thus potentially alter their catalytic and chemical properties. Here, we investigated the transformation mechanisms of three biogenic OP compounds and ZnO NPs under ultraviolet light (UV) illumination: inositol phosphates (IHPs), nucleic acids (DNA), and aminoethylphosphonic acid (AEP). The physicochemical characteristics of the resulting products were systematically characterized. Results show that ZnO NPs accelerated the transformation of IHPs, DNA, and AEP to inorganic phosphorus with the direct photolysis efficiencies of 98.14, 87.68, and 51.76%, respectively. The main component of the precipitates remained ZnO NPs, and Zn3(PO4)2 was identified. Zinc phytate was determined in the ZnO NP-IHP system. 31P NMR and FTIR further confirmed that the aquatic phase contained orthophosphate. Photoproduced hydroxyl (center dot OH) and superoxide (center dot O2-) were proved to play a dominant role in the OP photomineralization. Furthermore, ZnO NPs significantly enhanced the intensity of center dot OH and center dot O2- compared to the OP and Zn2+ solution alone. This work explored the light-induced mineralization processes of OP with ZnO NPs indicating that nanophotocatalysts may play a positive role in transformation of OP species in aquatic environments to further contribute to eutrophication."

There is a great need to develop novel treatment processes that can destroy nonaqueous PFAS at ambient temperatures and pressures. In this study, we develop a piezoelectric-material-assisted ball milling (PZM-BM) process built on the principle that ball collisions during milling can activate PZMs to generate similar to kV potentials for PFAS destruction in the absence of solvents. Using boron nitride (BN), a typical PZM, as an example, we successfully demonstrate the complete destruction and near-quantitative (similar to 100%) defluorination of solid PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) after a 2 h treatment. This process was also used to treat PFAS-contaminated sediment. Approximately 80% of 21 targeted PFAS were destroyed after 6 h of treatment. The reaction mechanisms were determined to be a combination of piezo-electrochemical oxidation of PFAS and fluorination of BN. The PZMBM process demonstrates many potential advantages, as the degradation of diverse PFAS is independent of functional group and chain configurations and does not require caustic chemicals, heating, or pressurization. This pioneering study lays the groundwork for optimizing PZM-BM to treat various PFAS-laden solid wastes."

The partitioning of SVOCs between airborne particles and the adjacent air influences human exposure and uptake. Presently, little direct experimental evidence exists about the influence of indoor particle pollution on the gas-particle phase partitioning of indoor SVOCs. In this study, we present time resolved gas-and particle-phase distribution data for indoor SVOCs in a normally occupied residence using semivolatile thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatography. Although SVOCs in indoor air are found mostly in the gas phase, we show that indoor particles from cooking, candle use, and outdoor particle infiltration strongly affect the gas-particle phase distribution of specific indoor SVOCs. From gas-and particle-phase measurements of SVOCs spanning a range of chemical functionalities (alkanes, alcohols, alkanoic acids, and phthalates) and volatilities (vapor pressures from 10-13 to 10-4 atm), we find that the chemical composition of the airborne particles influences the partitioning of individual SVOC species. During candle burning, the enhanced partitioning of gas-phase SVOCs to indoor particles not only affects the particle composition but also enhances surface off-gassing, thereby increasing the total airborne concentration of specific SVOCs, including diethylhexyl phthalate."

However, it is unclear how PHCZs are naturally produced. In this study, the formation of PHCZs from bromoperoxidase (BPO)-mediated halogenation of carbazole was investigated. A total of six PHCZs were identified in reactions under different incubation conditions. The presence of Br- significantly influenced the formation of PHCZs. The products were first dominated by 3-bromocarbazole and then 3,6-dibromocarbazole as the reactions proceeded. Both bromo- and chlorocarbazoles were identified in the incubations with trace Br-, suggesting the co-occurrence of BPO-catalyzed bromination and chlorination. However, BPO-catalyzed chlorination of carbazole was much weaker than that of bromination. The formation of PHCZs could be attributable to the halogenation of carbazole by reactive halogen species generated from BPO-catalyzed oxidation of Br- and Cl- by H2O2. The halogenation was found to follow a successive substitution order of C-3, C-6, and C-1 on the carbazole ring, forming 3-, 3,6-, and 1,3,6-isomers. Similar to the incubation experiments, six PHCZs were for the first time detected in red algal samples collected from the South China Sea, China, suggesting the biogenesis of PHCZs in marine red algae. Given the widespread distribution of red algae in the marine environment, BPO-catalyzed halogenation of carbazole may be a natural origin for PHCZs.

Here, we assessed the sediment properties and reactivities under depleted oxygen concentrations of Lake Tahoe, a deep ultraoligotrophic lake in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Using whole-core incubation experiments, we found that a decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration in the top 2 cm of the sediment resulted in an extension of the microbial iron reduction zone from below 4.5 to below 1.5 cm depth. Concentrations of reactive iron generally decreased with sediment depth, and microbial iron reduction seemingly ceased as concentrations of Fe(II) approximated concentrations of reactive iron. These findings suggest that microorganisms preferentially utilized reactive iron and/or iron minerals became less reactive due to mineral transformation and surface passivation. The estimated release of iron mineral-associated phosphorus is not expected to change Lake Tahoe's trophic state but will likely contribute to increased phytoplankton productivity if mixed into surface waters."

Here, transcriptional activities of 12 PFAS on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-alpha, -beta/delta, and -gamma) in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) were evaluated. All PFAS activated scPPAR-alpha in a dose-dependent manner. PFHpA exhibited the highest induction equivalency factors (IEFs). The order of IEFs for other PFAS was as follows: PFOA > PFNA > PFHxA > PFPeA > PFHxS > PFBA > PFOS > PFBuS approximate to PFDA >> PFUnDA and PFDoDA (not activated). The total induction equivalents ( n-ary sumation IEQs, 5537 ng/g wet weight) indicated that more attention should be paid to investigating contamination levels in dolphins, especially in PFOS (82.8% contribution to the n-ary sumation IEQs). The scPPAR-beta/delta and -gamma were not affected by any PFAS, except for PFOS, PFNA, and PFDA. Furthermore, PFNA and PFDA could induce higher PPAR-beta/delta and PPAR-gamma-mediated transcriptional activities than PFOA. Compared to human beings, PFAS might be more potent PPAR-alpha activators in humpback dolphins, suggesting that the dolphins may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of PFAS. Our results may be instructive for understanding the impacts of PFAS on marine mammal health due to the identical PPAR ligand-binding domain."

In this study, a dynamic magnetic field (DMF) was placed outside a digester to induce an electromotive force to electrically promote anaerobic digestion. With the applied DMF, an electromotive force of 0.14 mV was generated in the anaerobic sludge, and a 65.02% methane increment was obtained from the anaerobic digestion of wasteactivated sludge. Experiments on each stage of anaerobic digestion showed that acidification and methanogenesis that involve electron transfer of respiration chains were promoted with the DMF, while solubilization and hydrolysis less related to respiration chains were not enhanced. Further analysis indicated that the induced electromotive force polarized the protein-like substances in the sludge to increase the conductivity and capacitance of the sludge. Electrotrophic methanogens (Methanothrix) and exoelectrogens (Exiguobacterium) were enriched with DMF. The kinetic isotope effect test confirmed that electron transfer was accelerated with DMF. Consistently, the concentration ratio of co-enzymes (NADH/NAD(+) and F420H2/F-420) that reflects the electron exchange with respiration chains significantly increased. Applying the DMF seemed a more accessible strategy to electrically strengthen anaerobic digestion."

Herein, Pt catalysts on a TiO2 support with different crystal phases (rutile, anatase, and mixed phase (P25)) were prepared for catalytic oxidation of 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE). The Pt catalyst on P25-TiO2 (Pt/TiO2-P) showed optimal activity, selectivity, and stability, even under high-space velocity and humidity conditions. Due to the strong interaction between Pt and P25-TiO2 originating from the more lattice defects of TiO2, the Pt/TiO2-P catalyst possessed stable Pt-0 and Pt2+ species during DCE oxidation and superior redox property, resulting in high activity and stability. Furthermore, the Pt/TiO2-P catalyst possessed abundant hydroxyl groups, which prompted the removal of chlorine species in the form of HCl and significantly decreased the selectivity of vinyl chloride (VC) as the main byproduct. On the other hand, the Pt/TiO2-P catalyst exhibited a different reaction path, in which the hydroxyl groups on its surface activated DCE to form VC and enolic species, besides the lattice oxygen of TiO2 for the Pt catalysts on rutile and anatase TiO2.

Once formed, Br center dot further reacts with ozone to eventually form bromate. However, this reaction competes with the reaction of Br center dot with dissolved organic matter (DOM), of which reactivity and reaction mechanisms are less studied to date. To fill this gap, this study determined the second-order rate constant (k) of the reactions of selected organic model compounds, a DOM isolate, and monochloramine (NH2Cl) with Br center dot using gamma-radiolysis. The kBr center dot of all model compounds were high (kBr center dot > 108 M-1 s-1) and well correlated with quantum-chemically computed free energies of activation, indicating a selectivity of Br center dot toward electron-rich compounds, governed by electron transfer. The reaction of phenol (a representative DOM moiety) with Br center dot yielded p-benzoquinone as a major product with a yield of 59% per consumed phenol, suggesting an electron transfer mechanism. Finally, the potential of NH2Cl to quench Br center dot was tested based on the fast reaction (kBr center dot, NH2Cl = 4.4 x 109 M-1 s-1, this study), resulting in reduced bromate formation of up to 77% during ozonation of bromide-containing lake water. Overall, our study demonstrated that Br center dot quenching by NH2Cl can substantially suppress bromate formation, especially in waters containing low DOC concentrations (1-2 mgC/L)."

However, due to the complex structure of BC and the difficulty in identifying the intrinsic active sites, it is essential to understand the link between various properties of BC and the corresponding mechanisms promoting nonradicals. Machine learning (ML) recently demonstrated significant potential for material design and property enhancement to help tackle this problem. Herein, ML techniques were applied to guide the rational design of BC for the targeted acceleration of nonradical pathways. The results showed a high specific surface area, and O% values can significantly enhance nonradical contribution. Furthermore, the two features can be regulated by simultaneously tuning the temperatures and biomass precursors for efficient directed nonradical degradation. Finally, two nonradical-enhanced BCs with different active sites were prepared based on the ML results. This work serves as a proof of concept for applying ML in the synthesis of tailored BC for persulfate activation, thereby revealing the remarkable capability of ML for accelerating bio-based catalyst development."

However, widespread application of HCO is still limited due to the typically low efficacy of catalysts used and matrix passivation effects. To this end, we prepared an Al2O3-supported Fe catalyst with high reactivity via a facile urea-based heterogeneous precipitation method. Due to the nonsintering nature of the preparation method, a heterogeneous catalytic layer comprised of gamma-FeOOH and alpha-Fe2O3 is formed on the Al2O3 support (termed NS-FeAl2O3). On treatment of a real industrial effluent by HCO, the presence of NS-Fe-Al2O3 increased the removal of organics by similar to 100% compared to that achieved with a control catalyst (i.e., alpha-Fe2O3/Al2O3 or gamma-FeOOH/Al2O3) that was prepared by a conventional impregnation and calcination method. Furthermore, our results confirmed that the novel NS-Fe-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated resistance to the inhibitory effect of high concentration of chloride and sulfate ions usually present in industrial effluent. A mathematical kinetic model was developed that adequately describes the mechanism of HCO process in the presence of NS-Fe-Al2O3. Overall, the results presented here provide valuable guidance for the synthesis of effective and robust catalysts that will facilitate the wider industrial application of HCO."

However, the bottlenecks are the rational design of catalysts to selectively induce nonradicals and the interpretation of detailed nonradical generation mechanisms. Herein, we propose a new HCO process based on single-atom iron catalysts, in which Fe-N-4 sites anchored on the carbon skeleton exhibited outstanding catalytic ozonation activity and stability for the degradation of oxalic acid (OA) and p-hydroxybenzoic acid (pHBA) as well as the advanced treatment of a landfill leachate secondary effluent. Unlike traditional radical oxidation, nonradical pathways based on surface-adsorbed atomic oxygen (*O-ad) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) were identified. A substrate-dependent behavior was also observed. OA was adsorbed on the catalyst surface and mainly degraded by *O-ad, while pHBA was mostly removed by O-3 and O-1(2) in the bulk solution. Density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that one terminal oxygen atom of ozone preferred bonding with the central iron atom of Fe-N-4, subsequently inducing the cleavage of the O-O bond near the catalyst surface to produce *O-ad and O-1(2). These findings highlight the structural design of an ozone catalyst and an atomic-level understanding of the nonradical HCO process."

We quantified changes in soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and SOC to 2 m depth 10 years after biochar application to calcareous soil. The total soil carbon (i.e., existing SOC, SIC, and biochar-C) increased by 71, 182, and 210% for B30, B60, and B90, respectively. Biochar application at 30, 60, and 90 t ha-1 rates significantly increased SIC by 10, 38, and 68 t ha-1, respectively, with accumulation mainly occurring in the subsoil (below 1 m). This huge increase of SIC (mainly CaCO3) is similar to 100 times larger than the inorganic carbon present in the added biochar (0.3, 0.6, or 0.9 t ha-1). The benzene polycarboxylic acid method showed that the biochar-amended soil contained more black carbon particles (6.8 times higher than control soil) in the depth of 1.4-1.6 m, which provided the direct quantitative evidence for biochar migration into subsoil after a decade. Spectral and energy spectrum analysis also showed an obvious biochar structure in the biocharamended subsoil, accompanied by a Ca/Mg carbonate cluster, which provided further evidence for downward migration of biochar after a decade. To explain SIC accumulation in subsoil with biochar amendment, the interacting mechanisms are proposed: (1) biochar amendment significantly increases subsoil pH (0.3-0.5 units) 10 years after biochar application, thus forming a favorable pH environment in the subsoil to precipitate HCO3-; and (2) the transported biochar in subsoil can act as nuclei to precipitate SIC. Biochar amendment enhanced SIC by up to 80%; thus, the effects on carbon stocks in subsoil must be understood to inform strategies for carbon dioxide removal through biochar application. Our study provided critical knowledge on the impact of biochar application to topsoil on carbon stocks in subsoil in the long term."

This study aimed to investigate the effect of air pollution on human exosomal lncRNAs. A randomized, crossover trial was conducted among 35 healthy adults. Participants were allocated to 4 h exposure in road (high air pollution) and park (low air pollution) sessions in random order with a 2 week washout period. RNA sequencing was performed to measure lncRNAs. Differential lncRNAs were identified using a linear mixed-effect model. Mean concentrations of air pollutants such as ultrafine particles (UFP), black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were 2-3 times higher in the road than those in the park. Fifty-five lncRNAs [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05] including lncRNA NORAD, MALAT1, and H19 were changed in response to air pollution exposure. We found that 54 lncRNAs were associated with CO, 49 lncRNAs with UFP, 49 lncRNAs with BC, 48 lncRNAs with NO2, and 4 lncRNAs with PM2.5 (FDR < 0.05). These differential lncRNAs participated in dozens of pathways including cardiovascular signaling, epithelial cell proliferation, inflammation, and transforming growth factor.

The TMFs of OPFRs, except for TPHP and tributyl phosphate had a positive correlation with lipophilicity (log KOW, p < 0.05) and a negative correlation with the biotransformation rate (log KM, p < 0.05). The mean TMF > 1 was observed for all of the OPFR metabolites based on the bootstrap regression method. The pseudo-biomagnification of OPFR metabolites might be attributed to the biotransformation of OPFRs in organisms at high trophic levels."

During a period of 22 days, snails were fed with lettuce leaves that were root exposed to AgNO3 (0.05 mg/L), AgNPs (0.75 mg/L), TiO2NPs (200 mg/L), and a mixture of AgNPs and TiO2NPs (equivalent doses as for single NPs). The uptake rate constants (ku) were 0.08 and 0.11 kg leaves/kg snail/d for Ag and 1.63 and 1.79 kg leaves/kg snail/d for Ti in snails fed with NPs single-and mixture-exposed lettuce, respectively. The elimination rate constants (ke) of Ag in snails exposed to single AgNPs and mixed AgNPs were comparable to the corresponding ku, while the ke for Ti were lower than the corresponding ku. As a result, single TiO2NP treatments as well as exposure to mixtures containing TiO2NPs induced significant biomagnification from lettuce to snails with kinetic trophic transfer factors (TTFk) of 7.99 and 6.46. The TTFk of Ag in the single AgNPs treatment (1.15 kg leaves/kg snail) was significantly greater than the TTFk in the mixture treatment (0.85 kg leaves/kg snail), while the fraction of Ag remaining in the body of snails after AgNPs exposure (36%) was lower than the Ag fraction remaining after mixture exposure (50%). These results indicated that the presence of TiO2NPs inhibited the trophic transfer of AgNPs from lettuce to snails but enhanced the retention of AgNPs in snails. Biomagnification of AgNPs from lettuce to snails was observed in an AgNPs single treatment using AgNPs number as the dose metric, which was reflected by the particle number-based TTFs of AgNPs in snails (1.67, i.e., higher than 1). The size distribution of AgNPs was shifted across the lettuce-snail food chain. By making use of particle-specific measurements and fitting TK processes, this research provides important implications for potential risks associated with the trophic transfer of MNP mixtures."

We propose a method for scaling a SARS-CoV-2 bulk aerosol quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model for impulse emissions, coughing or sneezing, with aerosolized synthetic DNA tracer concentration measurements. With point-of-emission ratios describing relationships between tracer and respiratory aerosol emission characteristics (i.e., volume and RNA or DNA concentrations) and accounting for aerosolized pathogen loss of infectivity over time, we scale the inhaled pathogen dose and risk of infection with time-integrated tracer concentrations measured with a filter sampler. This tracer-scaled QMRA model is evaluated through scenario testing, comparing the impact of ventilation, occupancy, masking, and layering interventions on infection risk. We apply the tracer-scaled QMRA model to measurement data from an ambulatory care room to estimate the risk reduction resulting from HEPA air cleaner operation. Using DNA tracer measurements to scale a bulk aerosol QMRA model is a relatively simple method of estimating risk in buildings and can be applied to understand the impact of risk mitigation efforts."

However, the contributions of major agricultural and non-agricultural source emissions to NH3 at receptor sites remain uncertain in many regions, hindering the assessment and implementation of effective NH3 reduction strategies. This study conducted simultaneous measurements of the monthly concentrations and stable nitrogen isotopes of NHx (gaseous NH3 plus particulate NH4+) at 16 sites across China. Ambient NHx concentrations averaged 21.7 +/- 19.6 mu g m(-3) at rural sites, slightly higher than those at urban (19.2 +/- 6.0 mu g m(-3)) and three times of those at background (7.0 +/- 6.9 mu g m(-3)) sites. Based on revised delta N-15 values of the initial NH3, source apportionment results indicated that non-agricultural sources (traffic and waste) and agricultural sources (fertilizer and livestock) contributed 54 and 46% to NH3 at urban sites, 51 and 49% at rural sites, and 61 and 39% at background sites, respectively. Non-agricultural sources contributed more to NH3 at rural and background sites in cold than warm seasons, arising from traffic and waste, but were similar across seasons at urban sites. We concluded that non-agricultural sources need to be addressed when reducing ambient NH3 across China, even in rural regions."

However, their capacity for microbial inactivation and mechanisms of action require further investigation. We evaluated the efficacy of three POAs (performic acid (PFA), peracetic acid (PAA), and perpropionic acid (PPA)) and chlor(am)ine for inactivation of four representative microorganisms (Escherichia coli (Gram -negative bacteria), Staphylococcus epidermidis (Gram-positive bacteria), MS2 bacteriophage (nonenveloped virus), and 06 (enveloped virus)) and for reaction rates with biomolecules (amino acids and nucleotides). Bacterial inactivation efficacy (in anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) effluent) followed the order of PFA > chlorine > PAA approximate to PPA. Fluorescence microscopic analysis indicated that free chlorine induced surface damage and cell lysis rapidly, whereas POAs led to intracellular oxidative stress through penetrating the intact cell membrane. However, POAs (50 mu M) were less effective than chlorine at inactivating viruses, achieving only similar to 1-log PFU removal for MS2 and 06 after 30 min of reaction in phosphate buffer without genome damage. Results suggest that POAs' unique interaction with bacteria and ineffective viral inactivation could be attributed to their selectivity toward cysteine and methionine through oxygen-transfer reactions and limited reactivity for other biomolecules. These mechanistic insights could inform the application of POAs in water and wastewater treatment."

However, the toxicity evolution of biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) during atmospheric aging remains poorly understood. In this study, we report a unique set of chemical and toxicological metrics of BBOA from pine wood smoldering during multiphase aging by gasphase hydroxyl radicals (OH). Both the fresh and OH-aged BBOA show activity relevant to adverse health outcomes. The results from two acellular assays (DTT and DCFH) show significant oxidative potential (OP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in OH-aged BBOA. Also, radical concentrations in the aerosol assessed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy increased by 50% following heterogeneous aging. This enhancement was accompanied by a transition from predominantly carboncentered radicals (85%) in the fresh aerosol to predominantly oxygen-centered radicals (76%) following aging. Both the fresh and aged biomass burning aerosols trigger prominent antioxidant defense during the in vitro exposure, indicating the induction of oxidative stress by BBOA in the atmosphere. By connecting chemical composition and toxicity using an integrated approach, we show that short-term aging initiated by OH radicals can produce biomass burning particles with a higher particle-bound ROS generation capacity, which are therefore a more relevant exposure hazard for residents in large population centers close to wildfire regions than previously studied fresh biomass burning emissions."

Starting with phased reopening (i.e., June 2020), we sampled drinking water for 6 months from three commercial buildings with reduced water usage and four occupied residential households. Samples were analyzed using flow cytometry and full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing along with comprehensive water chemistry characterization. Prolonged building closures resulted in 10-fold higher microbial cell counts in the commercial buildings [(2.95 +/- 3.67) x 105 cells mL-1] than in residential households [(1.11 +/- 0.58) x 104 cells mL-1] with majority intact cells. While flushing reduced cell counts and increased disinfection residuals, microbial communities in commercial buildings remained distinct from those in residential households on the basis of flow cytometric fingerprinting [Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (dBC) = 0.33 +/- 0.07] and 16S rRNA gene sequencing (dBC = 0.72 +/- 0.20). An increase in water demand post-reopening resulted in gradual convergence in microbial communities in water samples collected from commercial buildings and residential households. Overall, we find that the gradual recovery of water demand played a key role in the recovery of building plumbing-associated microbial communities as compared to short-term flushing after extended periods of reduced water demand."

The results demonstrated that EA catalytic combustion consisted of three primary processes: EA hydrolysis (C-O bond breakage), the oxidation of intermediate products, and the removal of surface acetates/alcoholates. Rapid EA hydrolysis typically occurs on surface acid/base sites or hydroxyl groups, and the removal of surface acetates/alcoholates resulting from EA hydrolysis is considered the rate-determining step. The deposited acetates/alcoholates like a shield covered the active sites (such as surface oxygen vacancies), and the enhanced mobility of the surface lattice oxygen as an oxidizing agent played a vital role in breaking through the shield and promoting the further hydrolysis- oxidation process. The Cr modification impeded the release of surface-activated lattice oxygen from the CeO2 NBs and induced the accumulation of acetates/alcoholates at a higher temperature due to the increased surface acidity/basicity. Conversely, the Mnsubstituted CeO2 NBs with the higher lattice oxygen mobility effectively accelerated the in situ decomposition of acetates/ alcoholates and facilitated the re-exposure of surface active sites. This study may contribute to a further mechanistic understanding into the catalytic oxidation of esters or other oxygenated volatile organic compounds over CeO2-based catalysts."

The resulting societal challenges of the Anthropocene (e.g., climate change and impacts, renewable energy, adaptive infrastructure, disasters, pandemics, food insecurity, and biodiversity loss) are complex and systemic, with causes, interactions, and consequences that cascade across a globally connected system of systems. In this Critical Review, we turn to our origin story for insight, briefly tracing the formation of the Universe and the Earth, the emergence of life, the evolution of multicellular organisms, mammals, primates, and humans, as well as the more recent societal transitions involving agriculture, urbanization, industrialization, and computerization. Focusing on the evolution of the Earth, genetic evolution, the evolution of the brain, and cultural evolution, which includes technological evolution, we identify a nested evolutionary sequence of geophysical, biophysical, sociocultural, and sociotechnical systems, emphasizing the causal mechanisms that first formed, and then transformed, Earth systems into Anthropocene systems. Describing how the Anthropocene systems coevolved, and briefly illustrating how the ensuing societal challenges became tightly integrated across multiple spatial, temporal, and organizational scales, we conclude by proposing an evolutionary, system-of-systems, convergence paradigm for the entire family of interdependent societal of the Anthropocene."

We conducted a prospective case series to investigate the deposition of microplastics in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and determine the internal dose of MPs via inhalation. Eighteen never-smokers aged 32-74 years who underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BALF were recruited from Zhuhai, China. Control samples were obtained by performing the same procedure using isotonic saline instead of BALF. Laser direct infrared spectroscopy combined with scanning electron microscopy detected the presence and characteristics of MPs and quantitatively analyzed the microplastic in BALF and control samples. Concentrations of total and specific MPs in BALF and control samples were compared using the Wilcox test. Thirteen types of MPs were observed in 18 BALF samples. Polyethylene (PE, 86.1%) was the most abundant in BALF, followed by poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET, 7.5%) and polypropylene (PP, 1.9%). Compared with the control samples, BALF had significantly higher concentrations of PE (median [IQR] of BALF: 0.38 [8.05] N/g), PET (0.26 [0.54] N/g), polyurethane (0.16 [0.24] N/g), PP (0.16 [0.11] N/g), and total MPs (0.91 [6.58] N/g).

Herein, the impacts of MOF-74-Zn nanoparticles on neurological behaviors and neurotransmitter metabolism are explored in both in vivo and in vitro assays modeled by C57BL/6 mice and PC12 cells, respectively. The mice exhibit increased negative-like behaviors, as demonstrated by the observed decrease in exploring behaviors and increase in despair like behaviors in the open field test and forced swimming test after exposure to low doses of MOF-74-Zn nanoparticles. Disorders in the catecholamine neurotransmitter metabolism may be responsible for the MOF-74-Zn-induced abnormal behaviors. Part of the reason for this is the inhibition of neurotransmitter synthesis caused by restrained neurite extension. In addition, MOF-74-Zn promotes the translocation of more calcium into the cytoplasm, accelerating the release and uptake and finally resulting in an imbalance between synthesis and catabolism. Taken together, the results from this study indicate the human toxicity risks of nanoscale low-toxicity metal-based MOFs and provide valuable insight into the rational and safe use of MOF nanomaterials."

Hence, there is significant interest in strategies for enhancing reaction kinetics, especially in combination with efficient and economical carbocatalysts. This study compared the performance of four carbocatalysts (graphite, graphene oxide (GO), reduced-GO (rGO), and nitrogen-doped rGO (N-rGO)) in accelerating sulfisoxazole (SSX) oxidation by Mn(VII) and found that GO exhibited the greatest catalytic performance. Besides, the Mn-(VII)/GO system shows desirable capacities to remove a broad spectrum of TrOCs. We proposed that the degradation of SSX in Mn(VII)-GO suspensions follows two routes: (i) direct oxidation of SSX by Mn species [both Mn(VII) and in situ formed MnO2(s)] and (ii) a carbocatalyst route, where GO acts as an electron mediator, accepting electrons from SSX and transferring them to Mn(VII). We developed a mathematical model to show the contribution of each parallel pathway and found one-electron transfer is primarily responsible for accelerating SSX removal in the Mn(VII)/GO system. Findings in this study showed that GO provides a simple and effective strategy for enhancing the reactivity of Mn(VII) and provided mechanistic insights into the GO-catalyzed redox reaction between SSX and Mn(VII)."

Herein, a great synergistic effect of electrorepulsion and quaternary ammonium (QA) inactivation on maintaining antibacterial activity against biofouling has been investigated using an electrically conductive QA membrane (eQAM), which was fabricated by polymerization of pyrrole with QA compounds. The electrokinetic force between negatively charged Escherichia coli and cathodic eQAM prevented E. coli cells from reaching the membrane surface. More importantly, cathodic eQAM accelerated the detachment of cells from the eQAM surface, particularly for dead cells whose adhesion capacity was impaired by inactivation. The number of dead cells on the eQAM surface was declined by 81.2% while the number of live cells only decreased by 49.9%. Characterization of bacteria accumulation onto the membrane surface using an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance revealed that the electrorepulsion accounted for the cell detachment rather than inactivation. In addition, QA inactivation mainly contributed to minimizing the cell adhesion capacity. Consequently, the membrane fouling was significantly declined, and the final normalized water flux was promoted higher than 20% with the synergistic effect of electrorepulsion and QA inactivation. This work provides a unique long-lasting strategy to mitigate membrane biofouling."

While stable carbon isotope values (delta 13C) provide valuable insights into DOM transformations from land to ocean, it remains unclear how individual molecules respond to changes in DOM properties such as delta 13C. To address this, we employed Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) to characterize the molecular composition of DOM in 510 samples from the China Coastal Environments, with 320 samples having delta 13C measurements. Utilizing a machine learning model based on 5199 molecular formulas, we predicted delta 13C values with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.30%o on the training data set, surpassing traditional linear regression methods (MAE 0.85%o). Our findings suggest that degradation processes, microbial activities, and primary production regulate DOM from rivers to the ocean continuum. Additionally, the machine learning model accurately predicted delta 13C values in samples without known delta 13C values and in other published data sets, reflecting the delta 13C trend along the land to ocean continuum. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning to capture the complex relationships between DOM composition and bulk parameters, particularly with larger learning data sets and increasing molecular research in the future."

However, a comprehensive understanding of rate-limiting steps is lacking, let alone to enhance FCDI desalination by regulating the PAC characteristics. This study showed that the electron transfer between PAC and the current collector on the anode side was the rate-limiting step of FCDI desalination. Compared with W900, the desalination performance of FCDI decreased by 95% when W1200 with weak electron transfer ability was used as a flow electrode. The PAC selected in this study transferred electrons directly through the conductive carbon matrix in FCDI and was mainly affected by graphitization. The desalination performance of FCDI was improved by 20 times when the graphitization degree of PAC increased from 0.69 to 1.03. The minimum energy required for electrons to escape from the PAC surface was reduced by the high degree of graphitization, from 4.27 to 3.52 eV, thus improving the electron transfer capacity of PAC on the anode side. This study provides a direction for the optimization of flow electrodes and further promotes the development of FCDI."

The significantly increased malformation rate and declined survival rate specifically occurred in unexposed F2 larvae suggested transgenerational development toxicity by DBDPE. The changing profiles revealed by transcriptome and DNA methylome confirmed an increased susceptibility in F2 larvae and figured out potential disruptions of glycolipid metabolism, mitochondrial energy metabolism, and neurodevelopment. The changes of biochemical indicators such as ATP production confirmed a disturbance in the energy metabolism, whereas the alterations of neurotransmitter contents and light-dark stimulated behavior provided further evidence for multi-and transgenerational neurotoxicity in zebrafish.

Previous studies using pure cultures have demonstrated that bacteria with copper (Cu) resistance exhibited fitness advantages over Cu-sensitive bacteria under the pressure of protist predation. However, the impact of diverse natural communities of protist grazers on bacterial Cu resistance in natural environments remains unknown. Here, we characterized the communities of phagotrophic protists in long-term Cu-contaminated soils and deciphered their potential ecological impacts on bacterial Cu resistance. Long-term field Cu pollution increased the relative abundances of most of the phagotrophic lineages in Cercozoa and Amoebozoa but reduced the relative abundance of Ciliophora. After accounting for soil properties and Cu pollution, phagotrophs were consistently identified as the most important predictor of the Cu-resistant (CuR) bacterial community. Phagotrophs positively contributed to the abundance of a Cu resistance gene (copA) through influencing the cumulative relative abundance of Cu-resistant and-sensitive ecological clusters. Microcosm experiments further confirmed the promotion effect of protist predation on bacterial Cu resistance. Our results indicate that the selection by protist predation can have a strong impact on the CuR bacterial community, which broadens our understanding of the ecological function of soil phagotrophic protists."

"Assessing Detection Efficiencies for Continuous Methane Emission Monitoring Systems at Oil and Gas Production Sites"	"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY"			"English"	"Article"						"methane emissions; continuous monitoring; oil and gas; atmospheric dispersion modeling"		"Continuous monitoring systems, consisting of multiple fixed sensors, are increasingly being deployed at oil and gas production sites to detect methane emissions. While these monitoring systems operate continuously, their efficiency in detecting emissions will depend on meteorological conditions, sensor detection limits, the number of sensors deployed, and sensor placement strategies. This work demonstrates an approach to assess the effectiveness of continuous sensor networks in detecting infinite-duration and fixed-duration emission events. The case studies examine a single idealized source and a group of nine different sources at varying heights and locations on a single pad. Using site-specific meteorological data and dispersion modeling, the emission detection performance is characterized. For these case studies, infinite-duration emission events are detected within 1 h to multiple days, depending on the number of sensors deployed. The percentage of fixed-duration emission events that are detected ranged from less than 10% to more than 90%, depending on the number of sources, emission release height, emission event duration, and the number of sensors deployed. While these results are specific to these case studies, the analysis framework described in this work can be broadly applied in the evaluation of continuous emission monitoring network designs."

But its kinetics was often found to be slow in previous laboratory studies where high hydroxyl radical concentrations ([center dot OH]) were used. In this study, we performed heterogeneous oxidation experiments of several model OA systems under varied aging timescales and gas-phase [center dot OH]. Our results suggest that OA heterogeneous oxidation may be 2-3 orders of magnitude faster when [center dot OH] is decreased from typical laboratory flow tube conditions to atmospheric levels. Direct laboratory mass spectrometry measurements coupled with kinetic simulations suggest that an intermolecular autoxidation mechanism mediated by particle-phase peroxy radicals greatly accelerates OA oxidation, with enhanced formation of organic hydroperoxides, alcohols, and fragmentation products. With autoxida-tion, we estimate that the OA oxidation timescale in the atmosphere may be from less than a day to several days. Thus, OA oxidative aging can have greater atmospheric impacts than previously expected. Furthermore, our findings reveal the nature of heterogeneous aerosol oxidation chemistry in the atmosphere and help improve the understanding and prediction of atmospheric OA aging and composition evolution."

In this study, a PVC cable sheath was adopted as a representative kind of PVC material to investigate the release behaviors of short-and medium-chain CPs (SCCPs and MCCPs) under thermal treatment. Release percentages of CPs with increasing temperature followed a Gaussian-like curve. At the unmolten stage of 80 degrees C, heating for 10 min caused 0.051% of added SCCPs and 0.029% of added MCCPs to be released. At the molten stage of 270 degrees C, accumulative release rates of SCCPs and MCCPs within 10 min were up to 30 and 14%, respectively. The developed emission model indicated that material-gas partitioning and internal diffusion simultaneously governed the release of CPs. During thermal treatment, the release of CPs could be remarkably affected by the thermal expansion of the PVC material and the formation of breakage and micropores. Congener group profiles of released CPs indicated a slight fractionation effect for SCCPs during the release process. Furthermore, the release risk of CPs from the whole life cycle of PVC products was preliminarily evaluated."

However, there is a paucity of automated formula assignment methods for ESI(+)-FT-ICR MS spectra. The novel automated formula assignment algorithm for ESI(+)-FT-ICR MS spectra developed herein has been applied to elucidate the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in groundwater during air-induced ferrous [Fe(II)] oxidation. The ESI(+)-FT-ICR MS spectra of groundwater DOM were profoundly impacted by [M + Na]+ adducts and, to a lesser extent, [M + K]+ adducts. Oxygen-poor and N-containing compounds were frequently detected when the FT-ICR MS was operated in the ESI(+) mode, while the components with higher carbon oxidation states were preferentially ionized in the negative-ion electrospray ionization [ESI(-)] mode. Values for the difference between double-bond equivalents and the number of oxygen atoms from -13 to 13 are proposed for the formula assignment of the ESI(+)-FT-ICR MS spectra of aquatic DOM. Furthermore, for the first time, the Fe(II)-mediated formation of highly toxic organic iodine species was reported in groundwater rich in Fe(II), iodide, and DOM. The results of this study not only shed light on the further algorithm development for comprehensive characterization of DOM by ESI(-)-FT-ICR MS and ESI(+)-FT-ICR MS but also highlight the importance of appropriate treatment of specific groundwater prior to use."

However, a recently reported low pH of fresh supermicron sea spray aerosols (mainly sea salt) would argue against the importance of this mechanism. Here, we investigated the impact of ionic strength on the kinetics of multiphase oxidation of SO2 by O3 in proxies of aqueous acidified sea salt aerosols with buffered pH of similar to 4.0 via well-controlled flow tube experiments. We find that the sulfate formation rate for the O3 oxidation pathway proceeds 7.9 to 233 times faster under high ionic strength conditions of 2-14 mol kg-1 compared to the dilute bulk solutions. The ionic strength effect is likely to sustain the importance of multiphase oxidation of SO2 by O3 in sea salt aerosols in the marine atmosphere. Our results indicate that atmospheric models should consider the ionic strength effects on the multiphase oxidation of SO2 by O3 in sea salt aerosols to improve the predictions of the sulfate formation rate and the sulfate aerosol budget in the marine atmosphere."

Unscrambling the structural footprint of DOM is key to understand its biogeochemical transformations at the mechanistic level. Although numerous studies have improved our knowledge of DOM chemical makeup, its three-dimensional picture remains largely unrevealed. In this work, we compare four solid phase extracted (SPE) DOM samples from three different freshwater ecosystems using high resolution mobility and ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance tandem mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS/MS). Structural families were identified based on neutral losses at the level of nominal mass using continuous accumulation of selected ions-collision induced dissociation (CASI-CID)FT-ICR MS/MS. Comparison of the structural families indicated dissimilarities in the structural footprint of this sample set. The structural family representation using Cytoscape software revealed characteristic clustering patterns among the DOM samples, thus confirming clear differences at the structural level (Only 10% is common across the four samples.). The analysis at the level of neutral loss-based functionalities suggests that hydration and carboxylation are ubiquitous transformational processes across the three ecosystems. In contrast, transformation mechanisms involving methoxy moieties may be constrained in estuarine systems due to extensive upstream lignin biodegradation. The inclusion of the isomeric content (mobility measurements at the level of chemical formula) in the structural family description suggests that additional transformation pathways and/or source variations are possible and account for the dissimilarities observed. While the structural character of more and diverse types of DOM samples needs to be assessed and added to this database, the results presented here demonstrate that Graph-DOM is a powerful tool capable of providing novel information on the DOM chemical footprint, based on structural interconnections of precursor molecules generated by fragmentation pathways and collisional cross sections."

However, during cooking, we found that chloramine residuals in tap water can react with iodide in table salt and organic matter in pasta to form iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs). While naturally occurring iodide in source waters is known to react with chloramine and dissolved organic carbon (e.g., humic acid) during the treatment of drinking water, this is the first study to investigate I-DBP formation from cooking real food with iodized table salt and chloraminated tap water. Matrix effects from the pasta posed an analytical challenge, necessitating the development of a new method for sensitive and reproducible measurements. The optimized method utilized sample cleanup with Captiva EMR-Lipid sorbent, extraction with ethyl acetate, standard addition calibration, and analysis using gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS. Using this method, seven I-DBPs, including six iodo-trihalomethanes (I-THMs) and iodoacetonitrile, were detected when iodized table salt was used to cook pasta, while no I-DBPs were formed with Kosher or Himalayan salts. Total I-THM levels of 11.1 ng/g in pasta combined with cooking water were measured, with triiodomethane and chlorodiiodomethane dominant, at 6.7 and 1.3 ng/g, respectively. Calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of I-THMs for the pasta with cooking water were 126-and 18-fold, respectively, compared to the corresponding chloraminated tap water. However, when the cooked pasta was separated (strained) from the pasta water, chlorodiiodomethane was the dominant I-THM, and lower levels of total I-THMs (retaining 30% of the I-THMs) and calculated toxicity were observed. This study highlights an overlooked source of exposure to toxic I-DBPs. At the same time, the formation of I-DBPs can be avoided by boiling the pasta without a lid and adding iodized salt after cooking."

CH4 oxidation in Arctic soil plays a critical role in the process, whereby removal of up to 90% of CH4 produced in soils by methanotrophs can occur before it reaches the atmosphere. Previous studies have reported on the importance of rising temperatures in CH4 oxidation, but because the Arctic is typically an N-limited system, fewer studies on the effects of inorganic nitrogen (N) have been reported. However, climate change and an increase of available N caused by anthropogenic activities have recently been reported, which may cause a drastic change in CH4 oxidation in Arctic soils. In this study, we demonstrate that excessive levels of available N in soil cause an increase in net CH4 emissions via the reduction of CH4 oxidation in surface soil in the Arctic tundra. In vitro experiments suggested that N in the form of NO3- is responsible for the decrease in CH4 oxidation via influencing soil bacterial and methanotrophic communities. The findings of our meta-analysis suggest that CH4 oxidation in the boreal biome is more susceptible to the addition of N than in other biomes. We provide evidence that CH4 emissions in Arctic tundra can be enhanced by an increase of available N, with profound implications for modeling CH4 dynamics in Arctic regions."

C. teleta was exposed to sediment spiked particles of NCFs and SCFs at an environmentally realistic concentration (0.1 mg particles g-1 dw sed) and a 100-fold higher (10 mg particles g-1 dw sed) concentration. Experimental setup incorporated 11 individual endpoints and lasted approximately 6 months. There were significant effects on all endpoints, except from adult body volume and egestion rate, in worms exposed to 10 mg SCF particles g-1 dw sed. Although not statistically significant, there was >= 50% impact on time between reproductive events and number of eggs per female at 0.1 mg SCF particles g-1 dw sed. None of the endpoints was significantly affected by NCFs. Results suggest that SCFs are likely to affect individual life-history traits of C. teleta, whereas the population model suggests that these effects might not transform into population-level effects.

Halobenzoquinones (HBQs), a group of highly toxic emerging disinfection byproducts (DBPs), can be metabolized by reacting with glutathione (GSH) to form various glutathionylated conjugates (SG-HBQs). In this study, the cytotoxicity of HBQs in CHO-K1 cells showed a wavy curve as a function of increased GSH dosage, which was inconsistent with the commonly recognized progressive detoxification curve. We hypothesized that the formation and cytotoxicity of GSH-mediated HBQ metabolites contribute to the unusual wave-shaped cytotoxicity curve. Results showed that glutathionyl-methoxyl HBQs (SG-MeO-HBQs) were identified to be the primary metabolites significantly correlated with the unusual cytotoxicity variation of HBQs. The formation pathway was initiated by stepwise metabolism via hydroxylation and glutathionylation to produce detoxified hydroxyl HBQs (OH-HBQs) and SG-HBQs, followed by methylation to generate SG-MeO-HBQs of potentiated toxicity. To further verify the occurrence of the aforementioned metabolism in vivo, SG-HBQs and SG-MeO-HBQs were detected in the liver, kidney, spleen, testis, bladder, and feces of HBQ-exposed mice, with the highest concentration quantified in the liver. The present study supported that the co occurrence of metabolism can be antagonistic, which enhanced our understanding of the toxicity and metabolic mechanism of HBQs."

Here, metal-chelating organic ligands (lactate, oxalate, citrate, and ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) were amended to the bactericidal assays such that the importance of the two processes could be evaluated. Reduced nontronite (rNAu-2) was used as a model clay mineral to produce extracellular hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) upon oxygenation. The presence of Fe-chelating ligands increased center dot OH yield by 3-5 times. Consequently, bacterial cell membrane attack was enhanced, yet the antibacterial activity of RIC diminished. Additional experiments revealed that the ligands inhibited soluble metal ions from adsorption onto the bacterial cell membrane and/or penetration into the cytoplasm. Consequently, intracellular Fe concentration for the ligand-treated group was nearly 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for no-ligand control, which greatly decreased intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased cell survival. These results highlight that destruction of intracellular contents (proteins and DNA) is more important than oxidative degradation of membrane lipids and cell envelope proteins in causing bacterial cell death by RIC."

Herein, it was found that only 59% of bisphenol A (BPA), 47% of bisphenol F (BPF), 65% of acetaminophen (AAP), and 49% of 4-tertbutylphenol (4-tBP) were oxidized by 20 mu M of Fe(VI), while 97% of BPA, 95% of BPF, 96% of AAP, and 94% of 4-tBP could be oxidized by the Fe(VI)/Mn(II) system [20 mu M Fe(VI)/20 mu M Mn(II)] at pH 7.0. Further investigations showed that bisphenol S (BPS) was highly reactive with reactive iron species (RFeS) but was sluggish with reactive manganese species (RMnS). By using BPS and methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) as the probe compounds, it was found that reactive iron species contributed primarily for BPA oxidation at low Mn(II)/Fe(VI) molar ratios (below 0.1), while reactive manganese species [Mn(VII)/Mn(III)] contributed increasingly for BPA oxidation with the elevation of the Mn(II)/Fe(VI) molar ratio (from 0.1 to 3.0). In the interaction of Mn(II) and Fe(VI), the transfer of oxidation capacity from Fe(VI) to Mn(III), including the formation of Mn(VII) and the inhibition of Fe(VI) self-decay, improved the amount of electron equivalents per Fe(VI) for BPA oxidation. UV-vis spectra and dominant transformation product analysis further revealed the evolution of iron and manganese species at different Mn(II)/Fe(VI) molar ratios."

This study investigates inhibitive corrosion control strategies through adjustments of chemical water parameters (i.e., pH, silicate, phosphate, calcium, and alkalinity) on Cr(VI) formation through oxidation of Cr(0)(s) by free chlorine under drinking water conditions. The results show that an increase in pH, silicate, alkalinity, and calcium suppressed Cr(VI) formation that was mainly attributed to in situ surface precipitation of new Cr(III) solids on the surface of Cr(0)(s), including Cr(OH)3(s), Cr2(SiO3)3(s), CrPO4(s), Cr2(CO3)3(s), and Cr10Ca(CO3)16(s). The Cr(III) surface precipitates were much less reactive with chlorine than Cr(0)(s) and suppressed the Cr redox reactivity. The concentration of surface Cr(III) solids was inversely correlated with the rate constant of Cr(VI) formation. Adding phosphate either promoted or inhibited the Cr(VI) formation, depending on the phosphate concentration. This study provides fundamental insight into the Cr(VI) formation mechanisms via Cr(0) oxidation by chlorine and the importance of surface precipitation of Cr(III) solids with different corrosion control strategies and suggests that increasing the pH/alkalinity and addition of phosphate or silicate can be effective control strategies to minimize Cr(VI) formation."

However, poor low temperature activity and a narrow operation window restrict the industrial application of Ce-based oxide catalysts. Herein, the low-temperature NH3-SCR activity of Ce-based oxide catalysts was dramatically improved by Mn doping, and the mechanism was elucidated at the atomic level by experimental measurements and density functional theory calculations. We found that the addition of Mn significantly promoted the formation of surface oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies easily captured O2 in air and formed active oxygen species (superoxide and peroxide) on the surface. The surface active oxygen species efficiently oxidized NO into NO2 and then facilitated the fast SCR reaction. This study provides atomic-level insights into the promotion of the NH3-SCR activity over Mn-Ce composite oxides and is beneficial for the development of low-temperature Ce-based catalysts."

The dependence of salt permeability on salt concentration has been attributed to the variation of salt partitioning with feed salt concentration. However, studies using various analytical techniques revealed that the salt (total ion) partitioning coefficient decreases with increasing salt concentration, in marked contrast to the observed increase in salt permeability. Herein, we thoroughly investigate the dependence of total ion and co-ion partitioning coefficients on salt concentration and solution pH. The salt partitioning is measured using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), while the co-ion partitioning is calculated from the measured salt partitioning using a modified Donnan theory. Our results demonstrate that the co-ion and total ion partitioning behave entirely differently with increasing salt concentrations. Specifically, the co-ion partitioning increased fourfold, while total ion partitioning decreased by 60% as the salt (NaCl) concentration increased from 100 to 800 mM. The increase in co-ion partitioning with increasing salt concentration is in accordance with the increasing trend of salt permeability in RO experiments. We further show that the dependence of salt and co-ion partitioning on salt concentration is much more pronounced at a higher solution pH. The good co-ion exclusion (GCE) model -derived from the solution-friction model -is used to calculate the salt permeability based on the co-ion partitioning coefficients. Our results show that the GCE model predicts the salt permeabilities in RO experiments relatively well, indicating that co-ion partitioning, not salt partitioning, governs salt transport through RO membranes. Our study provides an in-depth understanding of ion partitioning in polyamide RO membranes and its relationship with salt transport."

However, limited studies are available on the foliar uptake of nanoscale nutrients and their interaction with plants. In this study, we reported the effects of foliar spray with varied concentrations of nanoscale silica (N-SiO2) and bulk tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS at 2000 ppm) on the growth and yield of groundnut. Nanosilica was prepared by a sol-gel method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and X-ray diffraction. The size and zeta potential of N-SiO2 were found to be 28.7 nm and 32 mV, respectively. The plant height, number of branches, total dry weight, SPAD chlorophyll meter reading, photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency, number of nodules, and ascorbic acid content were increased significantly with the N-SiO2 foliar application at 400 ppm over control. The number of filled pods increased significantly by 38.78 and 58.60% with N-SiO2 at 400 ppm application over TEOS and control, respectively. The pod yield per plant in N-SiO2 at 400 ppm increased by 25.52 and 31.7% higher over TEOS and control, respectively. Antioxidant enzyme activities enhanced significantly in N-SiO2 at 200 and 400 ppm over control, indicating a stimulatory effect on the plant growth. In addition, confocal microscopy revealed that fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-N-SiO2 entered through stomata and then transported to vascular bundles via apoplastic movement.

Results show that key common emission sources are electricity sector, non-metallic mineral products, and smelting and processing of metals in Shandong and Hebei. However, key common motivation sources are the construction sectors in Guangdong, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong. The key inflow regions include Guangdong and Zhejiang and key outflow regions include Jiangsu and Hebei. The emission reductions are attributed to the emission intensity effect of the construction sector; contrastingly, the emission increase is from the investment scale of the construction sector. Here, Jiangsu could be a key target for future emission reduction because of its high absolute emissions and low past reduction. The scale of investment in construction might be a significant factor in reducing emissions in Shandong and Guangdong. Henan and Zhejiang could concentrate on sound new building planning and resource recycling."

However, limited studies are available on the foliar uptake of nanoscale nutrients and their interaction with plants. In this study, we reported the effects of foliar spray with varied concentrations of nanoscale silica (N-SiO2) and bulk tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS at 2000 ppm) on the growth and yield of groundnut. Nanosilica was prepared by a sol-gel method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and X-ray diffraction. The size and zeta potential of N-SiO2 were found to be 28.7 nm and 32 mV, respectively. The plant height, number of branches, total dry weight, SPAD chlorophyll meter reading, photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency, number of nodules, and ascorbic acid content were increased significantly with the N-SiO2 foliar application at 400 ppm over control. The number of filled pods increased significantly by 38.78 and 58.60% with N-SiO2 at 400 ppm application over TEOS and control, respectively. The pod yield per plant in N-SiO2 at 400 ppm increased by 25.52 and 31.7% higher over TEOS and control, respectively. Antioxidant enzyme activities enhanced significantly in N-SiO2 at 200 and 400 ppm over control, indicating a stimulatory effect on the plant growth. In addition, confocal microscopy revealed that fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-N-SiO2 entered through stomata and then transported to vascular bundles via apoplastic movement. Our study for the first time demonstrated that N-SiO2 can significantly modulate multiple complex traits in groundnut through an eco-friendly and sustainable approach."	"[Prasad, T. N. V. K.

Herein, the NO3- formation pathways were comprehensively investigated based on model simulations com-bined with two-month field measurements at a rural site in the winter NCP. The results indicated that the nocturnal chemistry of N2O5 hydrolysis aloft could contribute evidently to ground NO3- at the rural site during the pollution episodes with high aerosol water contents, achieving the contribution percentages of 25.2-30.4% of the total. In addition to the commonly proposed vertical mixing of breaking nocturnal boundary layer in the early morning, two additional transport pathways (frontal downdrafts and downslope mountain breezes) in the nighttime were found to make higher contributions to ground NO3-. Considering the dominant role (69.6-74.8%) of diurnal chemistry in NO3- formation, reduction of NOx emissions in the daytime may be an effective control measure for reducing regional NO3- in the NCP."

However, the similar geochemical behaviors of REEs and transition metals often result in poor separation performance due to nonselectivity. Here, a unique approach based on the selective transformation between ceria sulfation and iron/ manganese mineralization was proposed, leading to the enhance-ment of the selective separation of REEs. The mechanism of the selective transformation of minerals could be ascribed to the distinct geochemical and metallurgical properties of ions, resulting in different combinations of cations and anions. According to hard -soft acid-base (HSAB) theory, the strong Lewis acid of Ce(III) was inclined to combine with the hard base of sulfates (SO42-), while the borderline acid of Fe(II)/Mn(II) prefers to interact with oxygen ions (O2-). Both in situ characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculation further revealed that such selective transformation might trigger by the generation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface of CeO2, leading to the formation of Ce2(SO4)3 and Fe/Mn spinel. Although the electron density difference of the configurations (CeO2-x-SO4, Fe2O3-x-SO4, and MnO2-x-SO4) shared a similar direction of the electron transfer from the metals to the sulfate-based oxygen, the higher electron depletion of Ce (QCe = -1.91 e) than Fe (QFe = -1.66 e) and Mn (QMn = -1.64 e) indicated the higher stability in the Ce-O-S complex, resulting in the larger adsorption energy of CeO2-x-SO4 (-6.88 eV) compared with Fe2O3-x-SO4 (-3.10 eV) and MnO2-x-SO4 (-2.49 eV). This research provided new insights into the selective transformation of REEs and transition metals in pyrometallurgy and thus offered a new approach for the selective recovery of REEs from secondary resources."

However, there is still a poor understanding about how it is transmitted. This work was designed to study the exhaled breath flow dynamics and transmission risks under different exhaling modes. Using an infrared photography device, exhaled flow characteristics of different breathing activities, such as deep breathing, dry coughing, and laughing, together with the roles of mouth and nose were characterized by imaging CO2 flow morphologies. Both mouth and nose played an important role in the disease transmission though in the downward direction for the nose. In contrast to the trajectory commonly modeled, the exhaled airflows appeared with turbulent entrainments and obvious irregular movements, particularly the exhalations involving mouth were directed horizontal and had a higher propagation capacity and transmission risk. While the cumulative risk was high for deep breathing, those transient ones from dry coughing, yawning, and laughing were also shown to be significant. Various protective measures including masks, canteen table shields, and wearable devices were visually demonstrated to be effective for altering the exhaled flow directions. This work is useful to understanding the risk of aerosol infection and guiding the formulation of its prevention and control strategies.

The emission of HFC-134a in China has been growing at an average annual growth rate of 14.4% since 2009, reaching 53.0 (47.5-58.7) kt yr-1 in 2020. Among the five emission sources, emissions from the mobile air conditioning (MAC) sector accounted for the highest proportion of 65% on average of the total, followed by the commercial air conditioning (CAC) sector (25%), the medical aerosols sector (8%), the foam sector (2%), and leakage emission from the production (less than 0.1%). The emissions of HFC-134a in four cities in China (Beijing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Lanzhou) were also estimated and discussed. Beijing had the highest HFC-134a emission of 2.2 kt yr-1 in 2020, and Lanzhou had the lowest emission of only 0.2 kt yr-1. In Beijing and Guangzhou, emissions from the CAC sector surpassed those from the MAC sector, becoming the most important source of HFC-134a. The average annual growth rate of HFC-134a's emissions during 2009-2019 was close to its concentration enhancement growth rate of 12.7%, and the emissions also showed significant correlations with the concentration enhancements in both China and four cities.

Here, we creatively propose a sustainable strategy for the direct resource transformation of livestock manure (LM) into an innovative catalyst (Fe-CCM) for water self -purification with zero external consumption. ECs can be rapidly degraded in this self-purification system at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, without any external oxidants or energy input, accompanied by H2O and dissolved oxygen (DO) activation. The performance of the self -purification system is not affected by various types of salinity in the wastewater, and the corresponding second-order kinetic constant is improved 7 times. The enhanced water self-purification mechanism reveales that intermolecular forces between anions and pollutants reinforce electron exchange between pollutants and metal sites on the catalyst, further inducing the utilization of the intrinsic energy of contaminants, H2O, and DO through the interfacial reaction. This work provides new insights into the rapid removal of ECs in complicated water systems with zero external consumption and is expected to advance the resource utilization of livestock waste."

However, hypohalous acid (HOCl and HOBr) can form via two-electron transfer directly from PMS, thus leading to the formation of organic halogenated byproducts as well. This study found both PMS alone and UV/PMS can increase the toxicity to mammalian cells of wastewater, while the UV/H2O2 decreased the toxicity. Cytotoxicity of two wastewater samples increased from 5.6-8.3 to 15.7-29.9 mg-phenol/L, and genotoxicity increased from 2.8-3.1 to 5.8-12.8 mu g 4-NQO/L after PMS treatment because of organic halogen formation. Organic halogen formation from bromide rather than chloride was found to dominate the toxicity increase. The SO4 center dot--based process UV/PMS led to the formation of both organic halogen and inorganic bromate and chlorate. However, because of the very low concentration (<20 mu g/L) and relatively low toxicity of bromate and chlorate, contributions of inorganic byproducts to toxicity increase were negligible. PMS would not form chlorate and bromate, but it generated a higher concentration of total organic halogen, thus leading to a more toxic treated wastewater than UV/PMS. UV/PMS formed less organic halogen and toxicity because of the destruction of byproducts by UV irradiation and the removal of byproduct precursors. Currently, many studies focused on the byproducts bromate and chlorate during SO4 center dot--based oxidation processes. This work revealed that the oxidant PMS even needs more attention because it caused higher toxicity due to more organic halogen formation."

OPEs with lower hydrophobicity were liable to be translocated acropetally, and rhizosphere microbiome could reduce the uptake and translocation of OPEs in rice tissues. New metabolites were successfully identified in rice and rhizosphere microbiome, including hydrolysis, hydroxylated, methylated, and glutathione-, glucuronide-, and sulfate-conjugated products. Rhizobacteria and plants could cooperate to form a complex ecological interaction web for OPE elimination. Furthermore, active members of the rhizosphere microbiome during OPE degradation were revealed and the metagenomic analysis indicated that most of these active populations contained OPE-degrading genes. The results of metabolomics analyses for phytotoxicity assessment implied that several key function metabolic pathways of the rice plant were found perturbed by metabolites, such as diphenyl phosphate and monophenyl phosphate. In addition, the involved metabolism mechanisms, such as the carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism and synthesis, and nucleotide metabolism in Escherichia coli, were significantly altered after exposure to the products mixture of OPEs generated by rhizosphere microbiome. This work for the first time gives a comprehensive understanding of the entire metabolism of OPEs in plants and associated microbiome, and provides support for the ongoing risk assessment of emerging contaminants and, most critically, their transformation products."

Forward osmosis (FO) has great potential in wastewater treatment only when appropriate draw solutes are available. Here, we synthesize a series of smart organic-inorganic polyoxomolybdates (POMs), namely, (NH4)6[Mo7O24], (PrNH3)6[Mo7O24], (iPrNH3)6[Mo7O24], and (BuNH3)6[Mo7O24], for FO to treat antiviral-drug wastewater. Influential factors of separation performance have been systematically studied by tailoring the structure, organic characteristics, and cation chain length of POMs. POMs at 0.4 M produce water fluxes ranging from 14.0 to 16.4 LMH with negligible solute losses, at least 116% higher than those of NaCl, NH4HCO3, and other draw solutes. (NH4)6[Mo7O24] creates a water flux of 11.2 LMH, increased by more than 200% compared to that of NaCl and NH4HCO3 in long-term antiviral-drug wastewater reclamation. Remarkably, the drugs treated with NH4HCO3 and NaCl are either contaminated or denatured, while those with (NH4)6[Mo7O24] remain intact. Moreover, these POMs are recovered by sunlight-assisted acidification owing to their light and pH dual sensitivity and reusability for FO. POMs prove their suitability as draw solutes and demonstrate their superiority over the commonly studied draw solutes in wastewater treatment."

Herein, we present a quantitative evaluation of remediation decisions from 206 contaminated sites throughout China between 2011 and 2021 using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and related statistical methodologies. Generally, remediation decisions seek to establish remediation goals (RGs) based on the risk control values (RCVs). Cumulative frequency distributions, followed non-normal S-curve, emerged multiple nonrandom clusters. These clusters are consistent with regulatory guidance values (RGVs), of national and local soil levels in China. Additionally, priority interventions for contaminated sites were determined by prioritizing RCVs and identifying differences across industrial sectors. Notably, we found that RCVs and RGs became more relaxed over time, effectively reducing conservation and unsustainable social and economic impacts. The joint probability curve was applied to model decision values, which afforded a generic empirically important RG of 0.57 mg/kg. Overall, these findings will help decision-makers and governments develop appropriate remediation strategies for BaP as a ubiquitous priority pollutant."

The mechanism behind this phenomenon is of great significance in the control of harmful algal blooms. To elucidate the role of Se(IV) in this effect, the reactions in ternary solutions composed of Se(IV), AA (or two other similar hydrogen donors), and quinones, especially benzoquinone (BQ), were investigated. The transformation kinetic results demonstrate that Se(IV) played a catalytic role in the reactions between AA (or ascorbic acid) and quinones. By comparison with five other oxyanions (sulfite, sulfate, nitrite, nitrate, and phosphate) and two AA derivatives, the formation of an AA-Se(IV) complexation intermediate was confirmed as a key step in the accelerated reactions between BQ and AA. To our knowledge, this is the first report on Se(IV) as a catalyst for quinone-involved reactions. Since both quinones and Se are essential in cells and there are many other chemicals of similar electron-donating properties to that of AA, the finding here shed light on the regulation of electron transport chains in a variety of processes, especially the redox balances that are tuned by quinones and glutathione."

Here, high-resolution NO observations were conducted simultaneously in the surface ocean and the lower atmosphere of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea; moreover, NO production from photolysis and microbial processes was analyzed. The NO sea-air exchange showed uneven distributions (RSD = 349.1%) with an average flux of 5.3 +/- 18.5 x 10-17 mol cm-2 s-1. In coastal waters where nitrite photolysis was the predominant source (89.0%), NO concentrations were remarkably higher (84.7%) than the overall average of the study area. The NO from archaeal nitrification accounted for 52.8% of all microbial production (11.0%). We also examined the relationship between gaseous NO and ozone which helped identify sources of atmospheric NO. The sea-to-air flux of NO in coastal waters was narrowed by contaminated air with elevated NO concentrations. These findings indicate that the emissions of NO from coastal waters, mainly controlled by reactive nitrogen inputs, will increase with the reduced terrestrial NO discharge."

Past studies have focused on the free amine groups, especially those in amino acids, as HAN precursors. This study reports, for the first time, that the indole moiety such as that in the tryptophan side chain is also a potent precursor for the most common HANs dichloroacetonitrile, bromochloroacetonitrile, and dibromoacetonitrile. 3-Indolepropionic acid, differing from tryptophan only in the absence of the free amine group, formed HANs at levels 57-76% of those by tryptophan at a halogen/nitrogen molar ratio of 10. Experiments with tryptophan-(amino-15N) showed that the indole contributed to 28-51% of the HANs formed by tryptophan. At low oxidant excess (e.g., halogen/ precursor = 5), 3-indolepropionic acid even formed more HANs than Trp by 3.5-, 2.5-, and 1.8-fold during free chlorination, free bromination, and chlorination in the presence of bromide (0.6 mg/L), respectively. Indole's HAN formation pathway was investigated by exploring the chlorination/bromination products of 3-indolepropionic acid using liquid chromatography-orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry. A total of 22 intermediates were detected, including pyrrole ring-opening products with an N- formyl group, 2-substituted anilines with different hydroxyl/halogen substitutions, and an intermediate with a postulated non aromatic ring structure."

These disturbances include not only direct emissions of particulates and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors but also changes in the pathways through which biogenic precursors form SOA. The composition of ambient organic aerosol is complex and incompletely characterized, encompassing millions of potential structures relatively few of which have been synthesized and characterized. Through analysis of submicron aerosol samples from the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon2014/5) field campaign by twodimensional gas chromatography coupled with machine learning, similar to 1300 unique compounds were traced and characterized over two seasons. Fires and urban emissions produced chemically and interseasonally distinct impacts on product signatures, with only similar to 50% of compounds observed in both seasons. Seasonally unique populations point to the importance of aqueous processing in Amazonian aerosol aging, but further mechanistic insights are impeded by limited product identity knowledge. Less than 10% of compounds were identifiable at an isomer-specific level. Overall, the findings (i) provide compositional characterization of anthropogenic influence on submicron organic aerosol in the Amazon, (ii) identify key season-to-season differences in chemical signatures, and (iii) highlight high-priority knowledge gaps in current speciated knowledge."

Herein, we demonstrate a superstable Hg3Se2Cl2 compound, which offers a promising next-generation flue gas mercury removal strategy. Theoretical calculations revealed a superstable Hg bonding structure in Hg3Se2Cl2, with the highest mercury dissociation energy (4.71 eV) among all known mercury compounds. Experiments demonstrate its unprecedentedly high thermal stability (>400 degrees C) and strong acid resistance (5% H2SO4). The Hg3Se2Cl2 compound could be produced via the reduction of SeO32- to nascent active Se0 by the flue gas component SO2 and the subsequent combination of Se0 with Hg0 and Cl- ions or HgCl2. During a laboratory-simulated experiment, this Hg3Se2Cl2-based strategy achieves >96% removal efficiencies of both Hg0 and HgCl2 enabling nearly zero Hg0 re-emission. As expected, real mercury removal efficiency under Se-rich industrial flue gas conditions is much more efficient than Se-poor counterparts, confirming the feasibility of this Hg3Se2Cl2-based strategy for practical applications. This study sheds light on the importance of stable demercury products in flue gas mercury treatment and also provides a highly efficient and safe flue gas demercury strategy."

For sectors that highly depend on electrification for decarbonization, it remains unclear how the increased electricity demand and consequent health impacts from sectoral mitigation policy in one province would change the scale and the regional and sectoral distributions of the overall health impacts in the whole country. This study chooses the banning of new sales of internal combustion engine vehicles in the private vehicle sector in China as a case. The results show that, without carbon neutrality and air pollution control goals in electricity generation, 53% of CO2 reduction and 65% of health benefits from the private vehicle sector would be offset by increased electricity demand. The regional distributions of CO2 reduction and health benefits due to a province-driven ban policy are greatly uneven, as the top five provinces take up over one-third of the total impact in China. Health benefits per ton of carbon reduction (H/C) may vary by up to 8 times across provinces.

This study investigated the cotransport of FHC with P and P/Ca in saturated sand columns. The results showed that P adsorption enhanced FHC transport, whereas Ca loaded onto P-FHC retarded FHC transport. Phosphate adsorption provided a negative potential on the FHC, while Ca added to P-FHC led to electrostatic screening, compression of the electric double layer, and formation of Ca5(PO4)3OH followed by heteroaggregation at pH >= 6.0. The monodentate and bidentate P surface complexes coexisted, and Ca mainly formed a ternary complex with bidentate P (-(FeO)2PO2Ca). The unprotonation bidentate P at the Stern 1-plane had a considerable negative potential at the Van der Waals molecular surface. Extending the potential effect to the outer layer of FHC, the potential at the Stern 2-plane and zeta potential exhibited a corresponding change, resulting in a change in FHC mobility, which was validated by comparison of experimental results, DFT calculations, and CD-MUSIC models. Our results highlighted the influence of P and Ca on FHC transport and elucidated their interaction mechanisms based on quantum chemistry and colloidal chemical interface reactions."

However, how different loadings and types of EPS and water chemistry conditions affect the sulfidation still lacks quantitative and systematic investigation. We here synthesized a set of ferrihydrite-organic matter (Fh-OM) coprecipitates with various model compounds for plant and microbial exopolysaccharides (polygalacturonic acids, alginic acid, and xanthan gum) and bacteriogenic EPS (extracted from Bacillus subtilis). Combining wet chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopic techniques, we systematically studied the impacts of C and S loadings by tracing the temporal evolution of Fe mineralogy and speciation in aqueous and solid phases. Our results showed that the effect of added OM on sulfidation of Fh-OM coprecipitates is interrelated with the amount of loaded sulfide. Under low sulfide loadings (S(-II)/Fe < 0.5), transformation to goethite and lepidocrocite was the main pathway of ferrihydrite sulfidation, which occurs more strongly at pH 6 compared to that at pH 7.5, and it was promoted and inhibited at low and high C/Fe ratios, respectively. While under high sulfide loadings (S(-II)/Fe > 0.5), the formation of secondary Fe-S minerals such as mackinawite and pyrite dominated ferrihydrite sulfidation, and it was inhibited with increasing C/Fe ratios. Furthermore, all three synthetic EPS proxies unanimously inhibited mineral transformation, while the microbiogenic EPS has a more potent inhibitory effect than synthetic EPS proxies compared at equivalent C/Fe loadings. Collectively, our results suggest that the quantity and chemical characteristics of the associated OM have a strong and nonlinear influence on the extent and pathways of mineralogical transformations of Fh-OM sulfidation."

Here, we demonstrate a 4-sulfocalix[4]arene (4-SCA)-modified graphene oxide (GO) membrane that shows extraordinary performance in separating mono from multivalent cations, as well as having reversible pH-responsiveness. The resulting 4-SCA-modified GO (SCA-GO) membrane preferentially transports potassium ions (K+) over radionuclide cations (Co2+, UO22+, La3+, Eu3+, and Th4+). The ion selectivities are an order of magnitude higher than that of the unmodified GO membrane. Theoretical calculations and experimental investigations demonstrate that the much-improved ion selectivity arises from the specific recognition between 4-SCA and radionuclide cations. The transport of multivalent radionuclides is impeded by a binding-obstructing mechanism from the host-guest interactions. Interestingly, the host-guest interactions are responsive to the protonation/deprotonation transformation of the 4-SCA. Therefore, the SCA-GO membrane mimics pH-regulated ion selective behavior found in biological ion channels. Our strategy of designing a biomimetic permselective GO membrane may allow efficient nuclear wastewater treatment and, more importantly, deepen our understanding of biomimetic ion transport mechanisms."

However, the intraplacental distribution of PFASs and their effects on placental vascular function remain unclear. In this study, 302 tetrads of matched subchorionic placenta (fetal-side), parabasal placenta (maternal -side), cord serum, and maternal serum samples were collected from Guangzhou, China. Eighteen emerging and legacy PFASs and five placental vascular biomarkers were measured. Results showed that higher levels of perfluorooctanoic (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acids (Cl-PFESAs) were detected in subchorionic placenta compared to parabasal placenta. There were significant associations of PFASs in the subchorionic placenta, but not in the serum, with placental vascular biomarkers (up to 32.5%) and lower birth size. Birth weight was negatively associated with PFOA (beta: -103.8, 95% CI: -186.3 and -21.32) and 6:2 Cl-PFESA (beta: -80.04, 95% CI: -139.5 and -20.61), primarily in subchorionic placenta. Mediation effects of altered placental angiopoietin-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 were evidenced on associations of adverse birth outcomes with intraplacental PFOS and 8:2 Cl-PFESA, explaining 9.5%-32.5% of the total effect. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report on differential intraplacental distribution of PFASs and placental vascular effects mediating adverse birth outcomes and provides novel insights into the placental plate-specific measurement in PFAS-associated health risk assessment."

The fluorinated compounds chosen were saflufenacil, penoxsulam, sulfoxaflor, fluoxetine, 4-nitro-3-trifluoromethylphenol (TFM), florasulam, voriconazole, and favipiravir, covering key fluorine motifs (benzylic-CF3, heteroaromatic-CF3, aryl-F, and heteroar-omatic-F). Quantum yields for the compounds were consistently higher for UV-C as compared to UV-A wavelengths and did not show the same trend as molar absorptivity. For all compounds except favipiravir and TFM, the fastest degradation was observed using 255 or 275 nm light, despite the low power of the LEDs. Using quantitative 19F NMR, fluoride, trifluoroacetate, and additional fluorinated byproducts were tracked and quantified. Trifluoroacetate was observed for both Ar-CF3 and Het-CF3 motifs and increased at longer wavelengths for Het-CF3. Fluoride formation from Het-CF3 was significantly lower as compared to other motifs. Ar-F and Het-F motifs readily formed fluoride at all wavelengths. For Het-CF3 and some Ar-CF3 motifs, 365 nm light produced either a greater number of or different major products. Aliphatic-CF2/CF3 products were stable under all wavelengths. These results assist in selecting the most efficient wavelengths for UV-LED degradation and informing future design of fluorinated compounds."

Edge surface acidity (with intrinsic reaction equilibrium constant, pK(a)) is a chemical property that is affected by crystal structure. While a cis-vacant structure predominates in natural montmorillonites, prior molecular-level studies assume a centrosymmetric trans-vacant configuration, which potentially leads to an incorrect prediction of montmorillonite acid-base surface properties. We computed intrinsic acidity constants of the surface sites of a montmorillonite layer with a cis vacant structure using the first-principles molecular dynamics-based vertical energy gap method. We evaluated pK(a) values for both non substituted and Mg-substituted layers on common edge surfaces (i.e., surfaces perpendicular to [010], [0 (1) over bar0], [110], and [(11) over bar0] crystallographic directions). The functional groups Si(OH), Al(OH2)(2)/ Al(OH)(OH2), and SiO(OH)Al sites on surfaces perpendicular to [010] and [0 (1) over bar0] and Si(OH)(U) , Si(OH)(L) , Al(OH2), and Al(OH2)(2) on surfaces perpendicular to [110] and [(11) over bar0] determine the proton reactivity of non-substituted cis-vacant edge surfaces. Moreover, the structural OH sites on edge surfaces had extremely high pK(a) values, which do not show reactivity at a common pH. Meanwhile, Mg2+ substitution results in an increase in pK(a) values at local or adjacent sites, in which the effect is limited by the distance between the sites. A surface complexation model was built with predicted pK(a) values, which enabled us to predict surface properties as a function of pH and ionic strength. Edge surface charge of both trans-and cis-vacant models has little dependence on Mg2+ substitutions, but the dependence on the crystal plane orientation is strong. In particular, at pH below 7, edge surfaces are positively or negatively charged depending on their orientation. Implications of these findings on contaminant adsorption by smectites are discussed."

Its utilization efficiency at contaminated sites is limited because most of the electrons from Fe0 are channeled to the reduction of water to H2 rather than to the reduction of the contaminants. Coupling Fe0 with H2-utilizing organohalide-respiring bacteria (i.e., Dehalococcoides mccartyi) could enhance trichloroethene conversion to ethene while maximizing Fe0 utilization efficiency. Columns packed with aquifer materials have been used to assess the efficacy of a treatment combining in space and time Fe0 and aD. mccartyi-containing culture (bioaugmentation). To date, most column studies documented only partial conversion of the solvents to chlorinated byproducts, calling into question the feasibility of Fe0 to promote complete microbial reductive dechlorination. In this study, we decoupled the application of Fe0 in space and time from the addition of organic substrates andD. mccartyi-containing cultures. We used a column containing soil and Fe0 (at 15 g L-1 in porewater) and fed it with groundwater as a proxy for an upstream Fe0 injection zone dominated by abiotic reactions and biostimulated/bioaugmented soil columns (Bio-columns) as proxies for downstream microbiological zones. Results showed that Bio-columns receiving reduced groundwater from the Fe0-column supported microbial reductive dechlorination, yielding up to 98% trichloroethene conversion to ethene. The microbial community in the Bio-columns established with Fe0-reduced groundwater also sustained trichloroethene reduction to ethene (up to 100%) when challenged with aerobic groundwater. This study supports a conceptual model where decoupling the application of Fe0 and biostimulation/bioaugmentation in space and/or time could augment microbial trichloroethene reductive dechlorination, particularly under oxic conditions."

This study reports the discovery of a new type of plastic material in the environment-plastic-rock complexes -formed when plastic debris irreversibly sorbs onto the parent rock after historical flooding events. These complexes consist of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or polypropylene (PP) films stuck onto quartz-dominated mineral matrices. These plastic-rock complexes serve as hotspots for MP generation, as evidenced by laboratory wet-dry cycling tests. Over 1.03 x 108 and 1.28 x 108 items center dot m-2 MPs were generated in a zero-order mode from the LDPE- and PP-rock complexes, respectively, following 10 wet-dry cycles. The speed of MP generation was 4-5 orders of magnitude higher than that in landfills, 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that in seawater, and >1 order of magnitude higher than that in marine sediment as compared with previously reported data. Results from this investigation provide strong direct evidence of anthropogenic waste entering geological cycles and inducing potential ecological risks that may be exacerbated by climate change conditions such as flooding events. Future research should evaluate this phenomenon regarding ecosystem fluxes, fate, and transport and impacts of plastic pollution."

We investigate the role of DOM composition in photoreactivity using 48 samples that span the range of DOM in freshwater systems and wastewater. We relate quantum yields for excited triplet-state organic matter (f TMP), singlet oxygen (phi 1O2), and hydroxylating species (phi center dot OH) to DOM composition determined using spectroscopy, Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, and electron-donating capacity (EDC). fTMP and phi 1O2 follow similar trends and are correlated with bulk properties derived from UV-vis spectra and EDC. In contrast, no individual bulk property can be used to predict phi center dot OH. At the molecular level, the subset of DOM that is positively correlated to both phi center dot OH and EDC is distinct from DOM formulas related to phi 1O2, demonstrating that center dot OH and 1O2 are formed from different DOM fractions. Multiple linear regressions are used to relate quantum yields of each PPRI to DOM composition parameters derived from multiple techniques, demonstrating that complementary methods are ideal for characterizing DOM because each technique only samples a subset of DOM."

However, sulfidation is a widespread biogeochemical process in nature, which inspired us to explore the biogenetic sulfidation of ZVI (BS-ZVI) with sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). BS-ZVI could degrade 96.3% of trichloroethylene (TCE) to acetylene, ethene, ethane, and dichloroethene, comparable to S-ZVI (97.0%) with the same S/Fe ratio (i.e., 0.1). However, S-ZVI (0.21 d-1) exhibited a faster degradation rate than BS-ZVI (0.17 d-1) based on pseudo -first-order kinetic fitting due to extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) excreted from SRB. Organic components of EPSs, including polysaccharides, humic acid-like substances, and proteins in BS-ZVI, were detected with 3D-EEM spectroscopy and FT-IR analysis. The hemiacetal groups and redox-activated protein in EPS did not affect TCE degradation, while the acetylation degree of EPS increased with the concentration of ZVI and S/Fe, thus inhibiting the TCE degradation. A low concentration of HA -like substances attached to BS-ZVI materials promoted electron transport. However, EPS formed a protective layer on the surface of BS-ZVI materials, reducing its TCE reaction rate. Overall, this study showed a comparable performance enhancement of ZVI toward TCE degradation through biogenetic sulfidation and provided a new alternative method for the sulfidation of ZVI."

Histological analyses of exposed organisms revealed a high proportion of abnormal and irregularly shaped intestinal epithelial cells. Disruption of the hepatic ceca and midgut epithelial tissues implied digestive functions and intestinal barriers were compro-mised. Synchrotron-based micro X-ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental mapping identified U co-localized with morphological changes, with substantial accumulation of U in the lumen as well as in the epithelial tissues. Utilizing high-resolution nano-XRF, 400-1000 nm sized U particulates could be identified throughout the midgut and within hepatic ceca cells, coinciding with tissue damages.

Here, we explore the effect of international trade on the carbon intensity of human well-being (CIWB) globally under the current global trade system and a hypothetical no-trade scenario. We found that between 1995 and 2015, CIWB of 41% of countries declined and 59% of countries increased, caused by international trade, and this resulted in a reduction of the global CIWB and a decline in CIWB inequality between countries. International trade decreased CIWB for high-and upper-middle-income countries and increased CIWB for lower-and middle-income countries. In addition, our results also show that decreases in emission intensity are the most important driver of lower CIWB and the percentage contribution of emission intensity to the improvement in CIWB increases with income. The reduction of emission intensity, population growth, and increase in life expectancy all contribute to CIWB reduction, while the consumption level is the primary factor driving CIWB growth. Our results underscore the importance of studying the impact of international trade on the CIWB of countries at different stages of development."

The relative risks (RRs) on all-cause, circulatory, and respiratory mortality were explored by a model combining a distributed linear lag model with quasi-Poisson regression. The definition in which daily PM2.5 increases more than 75 mu g/m(3) for at least 2 days and the average temperature falls below the 10th percentile for at least 2 days produced the best model fit performance in all-cause mortality. The high peaks of the health effect were generally observed around the lag days 6-9. The cumulative relative risks (CRRs) were more significant in the simultaneous-exposure scenario and higher in respiratory mortality, where the highest CRR (12.15, 3.69-40.03) was observed in definition P1T5, in which daily PM2.5 increases more than 75 mu g/m(3), and the average temperature falls below the 2.5th percentile for at least two days. For relative risk due to interaction (RERI), we found positive additive interactions (RERI > 0) between PM2.5 pollution and cold spell, especially in respiratory mortality. Clarifying the definition of combined events can help policymakers to capture health risks and construct more effective risk warning systems."

The moni-toring results show the ASC-PVDs method is suitable for deep soft ground improvement. After 302 days, the consolidation period was basically finished; the measured settlement of road center was -1.526 m, and the maximum lateral displacement of the slop toe was 453 mm (at the depth of -5 m).

Due to its health importance, selenium (Se) fate in the Mollisols attracts growing concerns. Land use change from conventional drylands to paddy wetlands impacts Se bioavailability in the vulnerable Mollisol agroecosystems. The underlying processes and mechanisms however remain elusive. Here, results of flow-through reactor experiments with paddy Mollisols from northern cold-region sites indicate that continuous flooding with surface water for 48 d induced redox zonation that facilitated the loss of Mollisol Se by up to 51%. Further process-based biogeochemical modeling suggests largest degradation rates of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in 30 cm deep Mollisols that contained the highest-level labile DOM and organic-bound Se. Electron shunting from degradation of Se-bearing DOM coupled to reductive dissolution of Se-adsorbed Fe oxides accounts mainly for Se(IV) release into the pore water. Consequent changes in DOM molecular composition make the reservoir of organic-bound Se vulnerable to flooding-induced redox zonation and likely enhance Se loss through destruction of thiolated Se and emission of gaseous Se from the Mollisol layer. This study highlights a neglected scenario where the speciation-driven loss of bioavailable Se from the paddy wetlands can be a significant consequence in the cold-region Mollisol agroecosystems."

However, micropollutants, such as metals, may also affect the flux of physiologically important polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). As certain PUFAs have been linked to physiological fitness and breeding success of terrestrial consumers, reduced fluxes from aquatic systems could affect terrestrial populations and food webs. We chronically exposed larvae of the aquatic insect Chironomus riparius to a range of environmentally relevant sediment contents of cadmium (Cd) or copper (Cu) in a 28-day microcosm study. Since elevated water temperatures can enhance metals' toxic effects, we used two temperature regimes, control and periodically elevated temperatures (heat waves) reflecting an aspect of climate change. Cd and Cu significantly reduced adult emergence by up to 95% and 45%, respectively, while elevated temperatures had negligible effects. Both metal contents were strongly reduced (& SIM;90%) during metamorphosis. Furthermore, the chironomid FA profile was significantly altered during metamorphosis with the factors sex and metal exposure being relevant predictors. Consequently, fluxes of physiologically important PUFAs by emergent adults were reduced by up to & SIM;80%. Our results suggest that considering fluxes of physiologically important compounds, such as PUFAs, by emergent aquatic insects is important to understand the implications of aquatic micropollutants on aquatic-terrestrial meta-ecosystems."

Bromine emissions are not required to be reported in the inventory, but are estimated as 173 Mg year(-1) Br-2 and 949 Mg year(-1) BrCl, representing a major uncounted oxidant source. A zero-dimensional photochemical box model reproduced the observed O(3 )depletions and demonstrated that bromine radical cycling was principally responsible for the rapid O3 depletion. Inclusion of observed halogen emissions in both the box model and a 3D chemical model showed significant increases in oxidants and particulate matter (PM2.5) in the populated regions of the Great Salt Lake Basin, where winter PM2.5 is among the most severe air quality issues in the U.S. The model shows regional PM2.5 increases of 10%-25% attributable to this single industrial halogen source, demonstrating the impact of underreported industrial bromine emissions on oxidation sources and air quality within a major urban area of the western U.S."	"[Chace, Wyndom S.] Williams Coll, Dept Chem, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA; [Chace, Wyndom S.; Brown, Steven S.] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Womack, Caroline C.; Chace, Wyndom S.; Wang, Siyuan; Fibiger, Dorothy L.; Franchin, Alessandro; Harkins, Colin; McDonald, Brian C.; Middlebrook, Ann M.; Neuman, Andrew; Veres, Patrick R.; Brown, Steven S.] NOAA, Chem Sci Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Womack, Caroline C.; Wang, Siyuan; Fibiger, Dorothy L.; Franchin, Alessandro; Harkins, Colin; McDuffie, Erin E.; Neuman, Andrew] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Baasandorj, Munkhbayar; Lin, John C.] Univ Utah, Dept Atmospher Sci, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Fibiger, Dorothy L.] Calif Air Resources Board, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA; [Franchin, Alessandro] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Goldberger, Lexie; Lee, Ben H.; Thornton, Joel A.] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Goldberger, Lexie] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99354 USA; [Jo, Duseong S.] NCAR, Atmospher Chem Observat & Modeling Lab, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [McDuffie, Erin E.] Washington Univ St Louis, Dept Energy Environm & Chem Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Moravek, Alexander; Murphy, Jennifer G.] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Moravek, Alexander] German Environm Agcy, Dept Air Qual, D-06844 Dessau Rosslau, Germany"	"Williams College; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; Washington University (WUSTL); University of Toronto"	"Womack, CC (corresponding author), NOAA, Chem Sci Lab, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.;Womack, CC (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA."

Here, we report intrinsic and extant kinetics as well as genome-resolved community characterization of a full-scale integrated fixed film activated sludge (IFAS) system where comammox and anammox bacteria co-occur and appear to drive nitrogen loss. Intrinsic batch kinetic assays indicated that majority of the aerobic ammonia oxidation was driven by comammox bacteria (1.75 +/- 0.08 mg-N/g TS-h) in the attached growth phase, with minimal contribution by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Interestingly, a portion of total inorganic nitrogen (similar to 8%) was consistently lost during these aerobic assays. Aerobic nitrite oxidation assays eliminated the possibility of denitrification as a cause of nitrogen loss, while anaerobic ammonia oxidation assays resulted in rates consistent with anammox stoichiometry. Full-scale experiments at different dissolved oxygen (DO = 2 - 6 mg/L) setpoints indicated persistent nitrogen loss that was partly sensitive to DO concentrations. Genome-resolved metagenomics confirmed the high abundance (relative abundance 6.53 +/- 0.34%) of two Brocadia-like anammox populations, while comammox bacteria within the Ca. Nitrospira nitrosa cluster were lower in abundance (0.37 +/- 0.03%) and Nitrosomonas-like ammonia oxidizers were even lower (0.12 +/- 0.02%).

Thus, studies of NP bioaccumulation should include organisms that have been previously exposed to NPs. Our study investigated the effects of pre-exposure of Tetrahymena thermophila (T. thermophila) to Fe2O3 or TiO2 NPs on the protozoan's subsequent uptake of 55Fe-labeled Fe2O3 (55Fe2O3) NPs. Molecular mechanisms underlying the pre-exposure effects were explored in tran-scriptomic and metabolomic experiments. Pre-exposure to either NPs inhibited the subsequent uptake of 55Fe2O3 NPs. The results of the transcriptomic experiment indicated that NP pre-exposure influenced the expression of genes related to phagosomes and lysosomes and physiological processes such as glutathione and lipid metabolism, which are closely associated with the endocytosis of 55Fe2O3 NPs. The differentially expressed metabolites obtained from the metabolomic experiments showed an enrichment of energy metabolism and antioxidation pathways in T. thermophila pre-exposed to NPs. Together, these results demonstrate that the pre-exposure of T. thermophila to Fe2O3 or TiO2 NPs inhibited the protozoan's subsequent uptake of 55Fe2O3 NPs, possibly by mechanisms involving the alteration of endocytosis-related organelles, the induction of oxidative stress, and a lowering of the intracellular energy supply.

In such complex environments, microorganisms often form surfaceattached communities known as biofilms. Biofilms can take the shape of clusters, which alter the distribution of fluid flow velocities within the porous medium, subsequently influencing biofilm growth. Despite numerous experimental and numerical efforts, the control of the biofilm clustering process and the resulting heterogeneity in biofilm permeability is not well understood, limiting our predictive abilities for biofilm-porous medium systems. Here, we use a quasi-2D experimental model of a porous medium to characterize biofilm growth dynamics for different pore sizes and flow rates. We present a method to obtain the time-resolved biofilm permeability field from experimental images and use the obtained permeability field to compute the flow field through a numerical model. We observe a biofilm cluster size distribution characterized by a spectrum slope evolving in time between -2 and -1, a fundamental measure that can be used to create spatio-temporal distributions of biofilm clusters for upscaled models. We find a previously undescribed biofilm permeability distribution, which can be used to stochastically generate permeability fields within biofilms. An increase in velocity variance for a decrease in physical heterogeneity shows that the bioclogged porous medium behaves differently than expected from studies on heterogeneity in abiotic porous media."

However, the heterogeneity of waste streams and the use of complex microbial communities can lead to undesirable reactions, thus decreasing process efficiency. We explored suppressing excessive ethanol oxidation to acetate (EEO) by increasing the hydrogen partial pressure (PH2) through hydro-genotrophic methanogenesis inhibition by periodically adding 2-bromoethanesulfonate (2-BES) to an MCCA-producing bioreactor to reach 10 mM of 2-BES upon addition. The bioreactor was fed with pretreated food waste and brewery waste containing high concentrations of short-chain carboxylic acids and ethanol, respectively. While 2-BES addition initially reduced EEO, some methanogens (Methanobrevibacter spp.) persisted and resistant populations were selected over time. Besides changing the methanogenic community structure, adding 2-BES also changed the bacterial community structure due to its impact on PH2. While we demonstrated that PH2 could be manipulated using 2-BES to control EEO, methods that do not require the addition of a chemical inhibitor should be explored to maintain optimum PH2 for long-term suppression of EEO."

However, we show here that the oxidation products of PMSO, formed on reaction with hydroxyl radical, enhance PMSO2 formation as a result of their complexation with Fe(III) leading to the changes in the reactivity of Fe(III) species in the homogeneous Fenton reaction. As such, PMSO should be used with caution to investigate the role of [(FeO)-O-IV](2+) in iron-based AOPs with these insights suggesting the need to reassess the findings of many previous studies in which this reagent was used. The other common target compounds, phthalhydrazide and hydroxybenzoic acids, were also found to modify the rate and extent of iron cycling as a result of complexation and/or redox reactions, either by the probe compound itself and/or oxidation products formed. Overall, this study highlights that these confounding effects of the aromatic probe compounds on the reactivity of iron species should be recognized if reliable mechanistic insights into iron-based AOPs are to be obtained."

This study built an integrated model (i.e., DECAF) estimate both territorial and exported emissions of China under three scenarios and assess the corresponding climate effects as well as abatement costs. Achieving near-zero territorial emissions by 2060 could avoid 23 +/- 4 Gt CO2-equiv of cumulative territorial emissions (compared to the 2019 Baseline scenario) during 2020-2060 at an average abatement cost of 9 +/- 6 USD/t CO2-equiv. Under the near-zero emission (including territorial and abroad) pathway, radiative forcing from HFCs will peak in 2037 (60 +/- 6 mW/m2) with a 33% peak reduction and 8 years in advance compared to the path regulated by the KA, and the radiative forcing by 2060 will be lower than that in 2019.

Pond-breeding amphibians can dominate aquatic animal biomass as larvae and are terrestrial prey as juveniles and adults. Thus, amphibians can be vectors of mercury exposure in both aquatic and terrestrial food webs. However, it is still unclear how mercury concentrations are affected by exogenous (e.g., habitat or diet) vs endogenous factors (e.g., catabolism during hibernation) as amphibians undergo large diet shifts and periods of fasting during ontogeny. We measured total mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg), and isotopic compositions (delta C- 13, delta N-15) in boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata) across five life stages in two Colorado (USA) metapopulations. We found large differences in concentrations and percent MeHg (of THg) among life stages. Frog MeHg concentrations peaked during metamorphosis and hibernation coinciding with the most energetically demanding life cycle stages. Indeed, life history transitions involving periods of fasting coupled with high metabolic demands led to large increases in mercury concentrations. The endogenous processes of metamorphosis and hibernation resulted in MeHg bioamplification, thus decoupling it from the light isotopic proxies of diet and trophic position. These step changes are not often considered in conventional expectations of how MeHg concentrations within organisms are assessed."

With increasing evidence of the accumulation of microplastics at sediment-water interfaces there is a need to assess their impacts on ecosystem engineers, also known as bioturbators, which have direct and indirect effects on ecosystem health. This study investigated the impact of microplastics on the bioturbator Tubifex tubifex alongside any effects on the biogeochemical processes at the sediment-water interface. Bioturbators were exposed to four sediment microplastic concentrations: 0, 700, 7000, and 70000 particles kg-1 sediment dry weight. Though no mortality was present, a significant response to oxidative stress was detected in tubificid worms after exposure to medium microplastic concentration (7000 particles kg-1 sediment dry weight). This was accompanied by a reduction in worm bioturbation activities assessed by their ability to rework sediment and to stimulate exchange water fluxes at the sediment-water interface. Consequently, the contributions of tubificid worms on organic matter mineralization and nutrient fluxes were significantly reduced in the presence of microplastics. This study demonstrated that environmentally realistic microplastic concentrations had an impact on biogeochemical processes at the sediment-water interface by reducing the bioturbation activities of tubificid worms."

Enhanced mixing ratios of ozone (O3) in urban areas during smoke-impacted periods occur through transport of O3 produced within the smoke or through mixing of pyrogenic volatile organic compounds (PVOCs) with urban nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) to enhance local O3 production. Here, we analyze a set of detailed chemical measurements, including carbon monoxide (CO), NOx, and speciated volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to evaluate the effects of smoke transported from relatively local and long-range fires on O3 measured at a site in Boulder, Colorado, during summer 2020. Relative to the smoke-free period, CO, background O3, OH reactivity, and total VOCs increased during both the local and long-range smoke periods, but NOx mixing ratios remained approximately constant. These observations are consistent with transport of PVOCs (comprised primarily of oxygenates) but not NOx with the smoke and with the influence of O3 produced within the smoke upwind of the urban area. Box-model calculations show that local O3 production during all three periods was in the NOx-sensitive regime. Consequently, this locally produced O3 was similar in all three periods and was relatively insensitive to the increase in PVOCs. However, calculated NOx sensitivities show that PVOCs substantially increase O3 production in the transition and NOx-saturated (VOC-sensitive) regimes. These results suggest that (1) O3 produced during smoke transport is the main driver for O3 increases in NOx-sensitive urban areas and (2) smoke may cause an additional increase in local O3 production in NOx-saturated (VOC-sensitive) urban areas. Additional detailed VOC and NOx measurements in smoke impacted urban areas are necessary to broadly quantify the effects of wildfire smoke on urban O3 and develop effective mitigation strategies."

Ignoring dissolved concentrations that drive transport and bioaccumulation often leads to an incomplete assessment of ongoing inputs to the water column and overestimation of potential effectiveness of sediment remediation. Here, we demonstrate the utility of codeployment of passive equilibrium samplers and freshwater mussels as dual lines of evidence to identify ongoing sources of PCBs from eight main tributaries of the Anacostia River in Washington, DC, that has been historically polluted from industrial and other human activities. The freely dissolved PCB concentrations measured using passive samplers tracked well with the accumulation in mussels and allowed predictions of biouptake within a factor of 2 for total PCBs and a factor of 4 for most congeners. One tributary was identified as the primary source of PCBs to the water column and became a focus of additional ongoing investigations. Codeployment of passive samplers and mussels provides strong lines of evidence to refine site conceptual models and identify ongoing sources critical to control to achieve river water quality standards and reduce bioaccumulation in the aquatic food web."

Thawed permafrost can enter water bodies through top-down thaw, thermokarst erosion, and slumping. Recent work revealed that permafrost contains ice-nucleating particles (INPs) with concentrations comparable to midlatitude topsoil. These INPs may impact the surface energy budget of the Arctic by affecting mixed-phase clouds, if emitted into the atmosphere. In two 3-4-week experiments, we placed 30,000-and 1000-year-old ice-rich silt permafrost in a tank with artificial freshwater and monitored aerosol INP emissions and water INP concentrations as the water's salinity and temperature were varied to mimic aging and transport of thawed material into seawater. We also tracked aerosol and water INP composition through thermal treatments and peroxide digestions and bacterial community composition with DNA sequencing. We found that the older permafrost produced the highest and most stable airborne INP concentrations, with levels comparable to desert dust when normalized to particle surface area. Both samples showed that the transfer of INPs to air persisted during simulated transport to the ocean, demonstrating a potential to influence the Arctic INP budget. This suggests an urgent need for quantifying permafrost INP sources and airborne emission mechanisms in climate models."	"[Barry, Kevin R.; Hill, Thomas C.

To date, EBM have primarily been applied in a research context, with a lower level of uptake by the water sector and regulators. This is partly due to concerns regarding the reliability and interpretation of EBM. Using evidence from the peer-reviewed literature, this work aims to answer frequently asked questions about EBM. The questions were identified through consultation with the water industry and regulators and cover topics related to the basis for using EBM, practical considerations regarding reliability, sampling for EBM and quality control, and what to do with the information provided by EBM. The information provided in this work aims to give confidence to regulators and the water sector to stimulate the application of EBM for water quality monitoring."

Previous studies have indicated that imidacloprid, a commonly used neonicotinoid, can cross the amphibian blood-brain barrier under laboratory conditions; however, little is known about the impact of low concentrations in a field-based setting. Here, we report aqueous pesticide concentrations at wetland production areas that were either connected or not connected to agricultural tile drains, quantified imidacloprid and its break down products in juvenile amphibian brains and livers, and investigated the relationship between imidacloprid brain concentration and brain size. Imidacloprid concentrations in brain and water samples were nearly 2.5 and 5 times higher at tile wetlands (brain = 4.12 +/- 1.92 pg/mg protein; water = 0.032 +/- 0.045 mu g/L) compared to reference wetlands, respectively. Tile wetland amphibians also had shorter cerebellums (0.013 +/- 0.001 mm), depicting a negative relationship between imidacloprid brain concentration and cerebellum length. The metabolite, desnitro-imidacloprid, had liver concentrations that were 2 times higher at tile wetlands (2 +/- 0.3 mu g/g). Our results demonstrate that imidacloprid can cross the amphibian blood-brain barrier under ecological conditions and may alter brain dimensions and provide insight into the metabolism of imidacloprid in amphibians."

This system yields a 75% reduction in CI to 15 gCO2e/MJ at a minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) of $2.24/ gallon ($0.59/L), a $0.31/gallon ($0.08/L) increase relative to the baseline no intervention case. The levelized cost of carbon abatement is 84 $/tCO2e. Sensitivity analysis reveals that carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative ethanol can be achieved when oxyfuel carbon capture is stacked with low-CI alternatives to grid power and fossil natural gas. Conservatively, fermentation and oxyfuel CCS can reduce the CI of conventional ethanol by a net 44-50 gCO2/MJ. Full implementation of interventions explored in the sensitivity analysis would reduce CI by net 79-85 gCO2/MJ. Integrated oxyfuel and fermentation CCS is shown to be costeffective under existing U.S. policy, offering near-term abatement opportunities."

The fate of BC transformation and cycling in marine sediments, however, has not been well studied. Here, we present radiocarbon measurements for sedimentary solid-phase BC (SBC) and porewater-dissolved BC (DBC) in surface sediments collected from the Yangtze and Yellow River estuaries and their adjacent coastal regions. Radiocarbon results revealed that two distinct BC pools in the sediments of the SBC had ancient radiocarbon ages (7110-15,850 years BP) that were 5370-14,935 years older than the 14C ages of porewater DBC. Using a radiocarbon mass balance model, we calculated that modern biomass-derived BC contributed 77-97% of the DBC pool and that fossil material-produced BC accounted for 61-87% of the SBC pools. This discrepancy between modern and dead BC contributions was associated with the BC budget after particulate BC (PBC) deposition; 38 +/- 13% of the PBC was transferred to porewater as DBC and 62 +/- 13% was sequestrated as SBC in sediments, serving as an important CO2 sink in marine sediments. We also provide evidence suggesting that DBC likely comprises some very fine particulate forms that are not completely dissolved as molecules. The nature and transformation mechanisms of DBC in natural aquatic systems need to be further studied."

Massive macroalgae released large amounts of organic carbon, most of which were transformed by microorganisms into dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Nearshore field investigations showed that, along with seawater deoxygenation and acidification, both DIC and total alkalinity (TAlk) increased significantly (both >50%) in the areas covered by dense U. prolifera at the late-bloom stage. Offshore mapping cruises revealed that DIC and TAlk were relatively higher at the late-bloom stage than at the before-bloom stage. Laboratory cultivation of U. prolifera at the late-bloom stage further manifested a significant enhancement effect on DIC and TAlk in seawater. Sulfate reduction and/or denitrification likely dominated the production of TAlk. Notably, half of the generated DIC and almost all the TAlk could persist in seawater under varying conditions, from hypoxia to normoxia and from air-water CO2 disequilibrium to re-equilibrium. The enhancement of TAlk allowed more DIC to remain in the seawater rather than escape into the atmosphere, thus having the longterm legacy effect of increasing DIC pool in the ocean."

However, FeII is susceptible to oxygen with its oxidation inevitably influencing the crystallization of vivianite. In this study, the profile of vivianite crystallization in the presence of dissolved oxygen (DO) was investigated at pHs 5-7 in a continuous stirred-tank reactor. It is found that the influence of DO on vivianite crystallization was highly pH-related. At pH 5, the low rate of FeII oxidation at all of the investigated DO of 0-5 mg/L and the low degree of vivianite supersaturation resulted in slow crystallization with the product being highly crystalline vivianite, but the P removal efficiency was only 30-40%. The removal of P from the solution was substantially more effective (to >90%) in the DO-removed reactors at pH 6 and 7, whereas the efficiencies of P removal and especially recovery decreased by 10-20% when FeII oxidation became more severe at DO concentrations >2.5 mg/L (except at pH 6 with 2.5 mg/L DO). The elevated degree of vivianite supersaturation and enhanced rate and extent of FeII oxidation at the higher pHs led to decreases in the size and homogeneity of the products. At the same pH, amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide (AFO)-the product of FeII oxidation and FeIII hydrolysis-interferes with vivianite crystallization with the induction of aggregation of crystal fines by AFO, leading to increases in the size of the obtained solids."

Surface and subsurface structures have each been studied in isolation as techniques to restore hyporheic exchange, but surface-subsurface structures have not been investigated or optimized in an integrated manner. Here, we used a numerical model to systematically evaluate key design variables for combined surface (i.e., weir height and length) and subsurface (i.e., upstream and downstream baffle plate spacing) structures. We also compared performance metrics that place differing emphasis on hyporheic flux versus transit times. We found that surface structures tended to create higher flux, shorter transit time flowpaths, whereas subsurface structures promoted moderate flux, longer transit time flowpaths. Optimal combined surface-subsurface structures could increase fluxes and transit times simultaneously, thus providing conditions for contaminant attenuation that were many times more effective than surface or subsurface structures alone. All performance metrics were improved by the presence of an upstream plate and the absence of a downstream plate. Increasing the weir length tended to improve all metrics, whereas the optimal weir height varied based on metrics. These findings may improve stream restoration by better aligning specific restoration goals with appropriate performance metrics and hyporheic structure designs."

Here, we first found that PFOA could significantly increase the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in unlined iron pipes (UIPs) during the distribution process. The increased DBPs were not due to the reaction of PFOA itself with free chlorine, but the in situ formed Fe-PFOA complex played a key role. Notably, PFOA could enhance iron release from UIPs and was greatly incorporated into the iron particles to form Fe-PFOA complex. The center dot OH generated by the Fe-PFOA heterogeneous reaction could break large dissolved organic matter into small molecules that had higher reactivity with chlorine. In addition, DBP precursors with more aromatic structures were favorable for forming strong Fe-pi interactions with Fe-PFOA complex, resulting in more center dot OH for the formation of aromatic DBPs. The cytotoxicity test showed that the viability of cells exposed to DBPs from UIPs with 100 ng/L PFOA was 46.9%, while that without PFOA was 67.91%. Overall, this study provided a new perspective on the risk of PFOA, with a focus not on PFOA itself but on its potential to promote DBP-associated toxicity in iron-based drinking water distribution pipes."

The methodology developed was illustrated by applying it to a specific turbot heat stress case study. Five plasma physiological indexes (epinephrine, cortisol, alkaline phosphatase, superoxide dismutase, and blood glucose levels) were measured in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) under acute heat stress at four temperatures (18, 21, 24, and 27 degrees C) for various exposure times (3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h). The SSP analysis showed that exposure time and temperature x gene interactions had significant (P < 0.01) effects on the activity/content of turbot plasma physiological indexes. The AMMI analysis showed the following: (1) that at each exposure time, the genotype effect > the genotype x temperature interaction > the temperature effect; (2) that during the whole experiment, the change trend of the contribution of the genotype x temperature interactions was similar to that of the temperature effect, and the changing trends of the contributions of the genotype x temperature interaction and the genotype effect were clearly completely reversed; and (3) that the 3-24-h period was the key period for the changes in the physiological indexes due to acute heat stress. The GGE biplot analysis showed that blood glucose and cortisol levels were reliable biomarkers and could be used as early warning markers for numerical simulations of physiological behavior."

We present a broad screening of chemicals in 21 plastic flake and pellet samples from Canadian recycling companies. From target analysis, the organophosphorus ester flame retardants and plasticizers exhibited the highest detection frequencies (DFs) (5-100%) and concentrations (<DL-4,700 ng/g), followed by brominated/chlorinated flame retardants (<DL-2,150 ng/g, 5-76% DFs). The perfluoroalkyl acids were least detected at the lowest concentrations (<0.01-0.70 ng/g, 5- 19% DFs). Using nontargeted analysis, 217 chemicals were identified as Level 1 (authentic standard) or 2 (library match), with estimated individual concentrations up to 1030 ng/g (highest: 2-hexyl hydroxy benzoate, 100% DF). Total (sigma 60) element concentrations were between 0.005 and 2,980 mg/kg, with highest concentrations for calcium (2,980 mg/kg), sodium (617 mg/ kg), and iron (156 mg/kg). Collectively >280 chemicals were detected in recycled plastic pellets and flakes, suggesting potential incorporation into recycled goods. Individual concentrations indicate unintentional trace contamination following European Union threshold limits for recycled granules (500 mg/kg) and waste plastic flakes (1,000 mg/kg), although do not reflect toxicological thresholds, if any. Our study highlights that while recycling addresses sustainability goals, additional screening of goods and products made from recycled plastics is needed to fully document potentially hazardous chemicals and exposure."

This work reports on the facile preparation, mechanistic elucidation, and kinetic evaluation of a bimetallic catalyst for highly active ClO3- reduction into Cl-. Under 1 atm H2 and 20 degrees C, PdII and RuIII were sequentially adsorbed and reduced on a powdered activated carbon support, affording Ru0- Pd0/C from scratch within only 20 min. The Pd0 particles significantly accelerated the reductive immobilization of RuIII as >55% dispersed Ru0 outside Pd0. At pH 7, Ru-Pd/C shows a substantially higher activity of ClO3- reduction (initial turnover frequency >13.9 min-1 on Ru0; rate constant at 4050 L h-1 gmetal-1) than reported catalysts (e.g., Rh/C, Ir/C, Mo-Pd/C) and the monometallic Ru/C. In particular, Ru-Pd/C accomplished the reduction of concentrated 100 mM ClO3- (turnover number > 11,970), whereas Ru/C was quickly deactivated. In the bimetallic synergy, Ru0 rapidly reduces ClO3- while Pd0 scavenges the Ru-passivating ClO2- and restores Ru0. This work demonstrates a simple and effective design for heterogeneous catalysts tailored for emerging water treatment needs."

The present study evaluated the effectiveness of previous in vitro screening for identifying PFAS capable, or incapable, of inducing estrogenic responses in fish exposed in vivo. Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed for 96 h to five PFAS (perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA]; 1H,1H,8H,8H-perfluorooctane-1,8-diol [FC8-diol]; 1H,1H,10H,10H-perfluoro-decane-1,10-diol [FC10-diol]; 1H,1H,8H,8H-perfluoro-3,6-diox-aoctane-1,8-diol [FC8-DOD]; and perfluoro-2-methyl-3-oxahexanoic acid [HFPO-DA]) that showed varying levels of in vitro estrogenic potency. In agreement with in vitro screening results, exposure to FC8-diol, FC10-diol, and FC8-DOD caused concentration-dependent increases in the expression of transcript coding for vitellogenin and estrogen receptor alpha and reduced expression of insulin-like growth factor and apolipoprotein eb. Once differences in bioconcentration were accounted for, the rank order of potency in vivo matched that determined in vitro. These results provide a screening level benchmark for worst-case estimates of potential estrogenic hazards of PFAS and a basis for identifying structurally similar PFAS to scrutinize for putative estrogenic activity."

However, the traditional experimental approach can be slow and expensive, and machine learning (ML) may provide new insights and guidance in membrane development for organic acid extraction. In this study, we collected extensive literature data and developed the first ML models for predicting separation factors between acetic acid and water in pervaporation with polymers' properties, membrane morphology, fabrication parameters, and operating conditions. Importantly, we assessed seed randomness and data leakage problems during model development, which have been overlooked in ML studies but will result in over-optimistic results and misinterpreted variable importance. With proper data leakage management, we established a robust model and achieved a root-mean-square error of 0.515 using the CatBoost regression model. In addition, the prediction model was interpreted to elucidate the variables' importance, where the mass ratio was the topmost significant variable in predicting separation factors. In addition, polymers' concentration and membranes' effective area contributed to information leakage. These results demonstrate ML models' advances in membrane design and fabrication and the importance of vigorous model validation."

In this study, degradation of chloramine residuals within authentic municipal wastewater effluents was achieved within a 30 min timescale using a reductive electrochemical reactor, which supplied electrons via a stainless-steel cathode under galvanostatic conditions without an ion exchange membrane separating the cathode and anode. Application of a 0.26 mA/cm2 cathodic current density reduced chloramines to ammonia and avoided oxidation at the IrO2-coated titanium anode of chloride to chlorine or chlorate and of ammonia to nitrite or nitrate. Net chloramine production was observed at a higher current density (2 mA/cm2). Chloramine degradation rates and Coulombic efficiencies were highest and electrical energy per order (EEO) values were lowest for the 304-grade stainless-steel cathode, which contains the highest nickel content, and for a stainless-steel cathode with a high surface area. Differences in ionic strength and pH were less important. For chloraminated municipal wastewater samples, the highest Coulombic efficiency was 4.1% and the lowest EEO value was 0.08 kWh/m3. An initial comparison indicated that the electricity cost associated with this EEO value would be comparable to the cost of sodium bisulfite for areas with low electricity costs."

We conducted a meta -analysis of vegetated BMPs in the International Stormwater BMP Database and compared influent and effluent nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations to quantify the BMP effect on nutrient management across climates. BMP effect on nutrient concentration change was compared between vegetated BMPs in wet and dry climates. We examined paired dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), total phosphorus (TP), and combinations of these analytes as dissolved inorganic ratios and N:P ratios. Meta-analysis with subgroup analysis was used to determine differences between wet and dry climates and among vegetated BMP types. We found that across both wet and dry climates, BMPs leach DIP and TP, increase the fraction of dissolved inorganic P (DIP:TP), and decrease dissolved N:P ratios. Dry-climate BMPs leach DIP and TP more consistently and at a higher magnitude than wet-climate BMPs, and bioretention leaches more DIP than grass strips and swales. These findings generally align with biogeochemical cycling, differences in influent chemistry, and BMP design types and goals."

Watershed legacy nitrogen storage, i.e., the long-term retention of nitrogen in soils and groundwater, is one of several explanations for this lack of progress. However scientists and water managers are ill-equipped to estimate how legacy nitrogen moderates in-stream nitrogen responses to land conservation practices, largely because modeling tools and associated long-term monitoring approaches to answering these questions remain inadequate. We demonstrate the need for improved watershed models to simulate legacy nitrogen processes and offer modeling solutions to support long-term nitrogen-based sustainable land management across the globe."

The dose-response relation between ambient PM2.5 exposure and mortality risk is the most fundamental information for assessments of the health effects of PM2.5. The existing dose- response relations were generally developed based on the assumption of equal contribution to toxicity from various sources. However, the sources of PM2.5 may significantly influence health effects. In this study, we conducted an ecological study to investigate the global long-term correlation between source-specific PM2.5 exposure and cause-specific mortality risk (SPECM) based on the regional aggregate data of the publically available official health databases from 528 regions worldwide with a total registered population of 3.2 billion. The results provided preliminary epidemiological evidence for differing chronic health effects across various sources. The relative mortality risks of lung cancer and circulatory diseases were closely correlated with the primary emissions from industrial and residential combustion sources. Chronic lower respiratory diseases were mostly associated with the mass concentration of particulate matter."

Although photochemical processes of Fe(III)-carbox-ylate complexes have been extensively studied in bulk aqueous solution, relevant information on the dynamic microdroplet system, which may be largely different from the bulk phase, is rare. With the help of the custom-made ultrasonic-based dynamic microdroplet photochemical system, this study examines the photochemical process of Fe(III)-citric acid complexes in microdroplets for the first time. We find that when the degradation extent of citric acid is similar between the microdroplet system and the bulk solution, the significantly lower Fe(II) ratio is present in microdroplet samples due to the rapider reoxidation of photogenerated Fe(II). However, by replacing citric acid with benzoic acid, no much difference in the Fe(II) ratio between microdroplets and bulk solution is observed, which indicates distinct reoxidation pathways of Fe(II). Moreover, the presence of center dot OH scavenger, namely, methanol, greatly accelerates the reoxidation of photogenerated Fe(II) in both citric acid and benzoic acid situations. Further experiments reveal that the high availability of O2 and the citric acid-or methanol-derived carbon-centered radicals are responsible for the rapider reoxidation of Fe(II) in iron-citric acid microdroplets by prolonging the length of HO2 center dot- and H2O2-involved radical reaction chains. The results in this study may provide a new understanding about iron-citric acid photochemistry in atmospheric liquid particles, which can further influence the photoactivity of particles and the formation of secondary organic aerosols."

The results of this study are the first of their kind, reporting pesticide concentrations at sub-sewershed sites within a single sewer catchment to provide information on the relative contribution from various urban sources. Seven monitoring events were collected from influent, efIluent, and seven sub-sewershed sites to capture seasonal variability. In addition, samples were collected from sites with the potential for relatively large mass fluxes of pesticides (pet grooming operations, pest control operators, and laundromats). Fipronil and imidacloprid were detected in most samples (>70%). Pyrethroids were detected in >50% of all influent and lateral samples. There were significant removals of pyrethroids from the aqueous process stream within the facility to below reporting limits. Imidacloprid and fiproles were the only pesticides that were detected above reporting limits in efIluent, highlighting the importance of source identification and control for the more hydrophilic compounds. Single source monitoring revealed large contributions of fipronil, imidacloprid, and permethrin originating from a pet groomer, with elevated levels of cypermethrin at a commercial laundry location.

This study used machine learning algorithms to assess which combinations of biomarkers and reported tobacco smoke exposure measures best differentiate children into three groups: no/minimal tobacco smoke exposure (NEG); predominant THS exposure (TEG); and mixed SHS and THS exposure (MEG). Participants were 4485 nonsmoking 3-17-year-olds from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-2016. We fitted and tested random forest models, and the majority (76%) of children were classified in NEG, 16% were classified in TEG, and 8% were classified in MEG. The final classification model based on reported exposure, biomarker, and biomarker ratio variables had a prediction accuracy of 95%. This final model had prediction accuracies of 100% for NEG, 88% for TEG, followed by 71% for MEG. The most important predictors were the reported number of household smokers, serum cotinine, serum hydroxycotinine, and urinary 4(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL).

We developed a correlative imaging workflow for targeted sampling of roots in their three-dimensional (3D) context and assessed the imprint of roots on chemical properties of the root-soil contact zone at micrometer to millimeter scale. Maize (Zea mays) was grown in N-15-labeled soil columns and pulse-labeled with (CO2)-C-13 to visualize the spatial distribution of carbon inputs and nitrogen uptake together with the redistribution of other elements. Soil columns were scanned by Xray computed tomography (X-ray CT) at low resolution (45 mu m) to enable image-guided subsampling of specific root segments. Resin-embedded subsamples were then analyzed by X-ray CT at high resolution (10 mu m) for their 3D structure and chemical gradients around roots using micro-X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (mu XRF), nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), and laser-ablation isotope ratio mass spectrometry (LA-IRMS). Concentration gradients, particularly of calcium and sulfur, with different spatial extents could be identified by mu XRF. NanoSIMS and LA-IRMS detected the release of C-13 into soil up to a distance of 100 mu m from the root surface, whereas N-15 accumulated preferentially in the root cells. We conclude that combining targeted sampling of the soil-root system and correlative microscopy opens new avenues for unraveling rhizosphere processes in situ."

Here, we modeled the potential global species extinction risk from future scenarios of climate mitigation and EU28 forest management. We considered the continuation of current practices, the adoption of closer-to-nature management (low-intensity practices), and set-asides (conversion to unharvested forestland) on portions of EU28 forestland under two climate mitigation pathways as well as the consequences for the wood trade. Expanding set-aside to more than 25% of EU28 currently managed forestland by 2100 increased the global extinction risk compared to the continuation of current practices. This outcome stems from a projected increase in EU forest biomass imports, partially from biodiversity-vulnerable regions to compensate for a decrease in domestic harvest. Conversely, closer-to-nature management on up to 37.5% of EU28 forestland lowered extinction risks. Increasing the internal production and partially sourcing imported biomass from low-intensity managed areas lowered the species extinction footprint even further. However, low-intensity practices could not entirely compensate for the increased extinction risk under a high climate mitigation scenario with greater demand for lignocellulosic crops and energywood. When developing climate mitigation strategies, it is crucial to assess forest biomass supply chains for the early detection of extinction risks in non-EU regions and for developing strategies to prevent increase of global impacts."

However, it is hard to do so because of the complex mechanisms of the EDCs. In this study, we propose a novel strategy named EDC-Predictor to integrate pharmacological and toxicological profiles for the prediction of EDCs. Different from conventional methods that only focus on a few nuclear receptors (NRs), EDC-Predictor considers more targets. It uses computational target profiles from network-based and machine learning-based methods to characterize compounds, including both EDCs and non-EDCs. The best model constructed by these target profiles outperformed those models by molecular fingerprints. In a case study to predict NR-related EDCs, EDC-Predictor showed a wider applicability domain and higher accuracy than four previous tools. Another case study further demonstrated that EDC-Predictor could predict EDCs targeting other proteins rather than NRs. Finally, a free web server was developed to make EDC prediction easier (http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/edcpred/). In summary, EDC-Predictor would be a powerful tool in EDC prediction and drug safety assessment."

In this study, the spatial distribution of microorganisms along with the biofilm depth in methane-based MBfRs was experimentally revealed, showing the dominance of anammox bacteria, n-DAMO bacteria, and n-DAMO archaea in the outer layer, middle layer, and inner layer of biofilms, respectively. The long-term and short-term experimental investigations in conjunction with mathematical modeling collectively revealed that microorganisms living in the outer layer of biofilms tend to use substrates from wastewater, while microorganisms inhabiting the inner layer of biofilms tend to use substrates originating from biofilm substratum. Specifically, anammox bacteria dominating the biofilm surface preferentially removed the nitrite provided from wastewater, while n-DAMO bacteria mostly utilized the nitrite generated from n-DAMO archaea as these two methane-related populations spatially clustered together inside the biofilm. Likewise, the methane supplied from the membrane was mostly consumed by n-DAMO archaea, while the dissolved methane in wastewater would be primarily utilized by n-DAMO bacteria. This study offers novel insights into the impacts of microbial stratification in biofilm systems, not only expanding the fundamental understanding of biofilms and microbial interactions therein but also providing a rationale for the potential applications of methane-based MBfRs in sewage treatment."

Removal of the metal oxide coating from the surface, leaving behind the white film, can be quantified and used as an indicator of reducing conditions in soils. Manganese IRIS, coated with birnessite, can also oxidize Fe(II), resulting in a color change from brown to orange that complicates the interpretation of coating removal. Here, we studied field-deployed Mn IRIS films where Fe oxidation was present to unravel the mechanisms of Mn oxidation of Fe(II) and the resulting minerals on the IRIS film surface. We observed reductions in the Mn average oxidation state when Fe precipitation was evident. Fe precipitation was primarily ferrihydrite (30-90%), but lepidocrocite and goethite were also detected, notably when the Mn average oxidation state decreased. The decrease in the average oxidation state of Mn was due to the adsorption of Mn(II) to the oxidized Fe and the precipitation of rhodochrosite (MnCO3) on the film. The results were variable on small spatial scales (<1 mm), highlighting the suitability of IRIS in studying heterogeneous redox reactions in soil. Mn IRIS also provides a tool to bridge lab and field studies of the interactions between Mn oxides and reduced constituents."

Removal of the metal oxide coating from the surface, leaving behind the white film, can be quantified and used as an indicator of reducing conditions in soils. Manganese IRIS, coated with birnessite, can also oxidize Fe(II), resulting in a color change from brown to orange that complicates the interpretation of coating removal. Here, we studied field-deployed Mn IRIS films where Fe oxidation was present to unravel the mechanisms of Mn oxidation of Fe(II) and the resulting minerals on the IRIS film surface. We observed reductions in the Mn average oxidation state when Fe precipitation was evident. Fe precipitation was primarily ferrihydrite (30-90%), but lepidocrocite and goethite were also detected, notably when the Mn average oxidation state decreased. The decrease in the average oxidation state of Mn was due to the adsorption of Mn(II) to the oxidized Fe and the precipitation of rhodochrosite (MnCO3) on the film. The results were variable on small spatial scales (<1 mm), highlighting the suitability of IRIS in studying heterogeneous redox reactions in soil. Mn IRIS also provides a tool to bridge lab and field studies of the interactions between Mn oxides and reduced constituents."

Untreated and free chlorine-treated viruses, and host cells synchronized-infected with these viruses, are analyzed by a reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method with the goal of quantitatively investigating the effect of free chlorine exposure on viral genome integrity, attachment to host cell, and viral genome replication.

In this work, we present the first ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) study of temperature dependent degradation dynamics of PFOA on (100) and (110) surfaces of gamma-Al2O3. Our results show that PFOA degradation does not occur on the pristine (100) surface, even when carried out at high temperatures. However, introducing an oxygen vacancy on the (100) surface facilitates an ultrafast (<100 fs) defluorination of C-F bonds in PFOA. We also examined degradation dynamics on the (110) surface and found that PFOA interacts strongly with Al(III) centers on the surface of gamma-Al2O3, resulting in a stepwise breaking of C-F, C-C, and C-COO bonds. Most importantly, at the end of the degradation process, strong Al-F bonds are formed on the mineralized gamma-Al2O3 surface, which prevents further dissociation of fluorine into the surrounding environment. Taken together, our AIMD simulations provide critical reaction mechanisms at a quantum level of detail and highlight the importance of temperature effects, defects, and surface facets for PFOA degradation on reactive surfaces, which have not been systematically explored or analyzed."

The structure parameter S of the PA film is measured to be 24.2 +/- 12.6 mu m, which is about 87-fold of its film thickness. A significant decline in water flux of the PA film from an ideal forward osmosis membrane is observed. We find that the decline is predominantly influenced by the internal concentration polarization (ICP) of the PA film based on our experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. We propose that the asymmetric hollow structures of the PA layer with dense crusts and cavities may be the underlying cause of the occurrence of the ICP. More importantly, the structure parameter of the PA film can be reduced and its ICP effect can be mitigated by tuning its structures with fewer and shorter cavities. Our results for the first time provide experimental evidence to prove that the PA layer of the TFC membrane has the ICP effect, which could potentially provide fundamental insights into the influence of structural properties of PA on the membrane separation performance."

However, existing in vivo POPs detection methods are limited by the lethal sampling of living organisms, complex sample preparation processes, or bulky testing equipment. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing with the merits of high sensitivity and simple equipment is a fast-developed method for in vivo analysis. A major obstacle for in vivo PEC sensors is the separated implantation of multiple electrodes and a light source, which raises concerns like multielectrode biofouling and electroactive molecules interference in the complex environment, uncertain electrode implant distance, and multiple insertion operations. Here, a coaxially implanted photofuel microsensor was developed by hiding the optical fiber-based photoanode inside the glass capillary-based biocathode, and the model target PCB77 can be detected with an ultralow detection limit (2.8 fg/mL). This unique photoanode-biocathode- light source integrated structure ensures excellent selectivity, good antifouling ability and biocompatibility, high accuracy, and less implant mechanical damage.

To better predict human exposure to MMHg, it is important to understand the trophic transfer of MMHg in the global marine food webs, which remains largely unknown, especially in the upper trophic level (TL) biota that is more directly relevant to human exposure. In this study, we couple a fish ecological model and an ocean methylmercury model to explore the influencing factors and mechanisms of MMHg transfer in marine fish food webs. Our results show that available MMHg in the zooplankton strongly determines the MMHg in fish. Medium-sized fish are critical intermediaries that transfer more than 70% of the MMHg circulating in food webs. Grazing is the main factor to control MMHg concentrations in different size categories of fish. Feeding interactions affected by ecosystem structures determine the degree of MMHg biomagnification. We estimate a total of 6.1 metric tons of MMHg potentially digested by the global population per year through marine fish consumption. The model provides a useful tool to quantify human exposure to MMHg through marine fish consumption and thus fills a critical gap in the effectiveness evaluation of the convention."

Besides physicochemical properties, this study for the first time evaluated the influencing effects of the primary components in human milk (carbohydrate, lipid, and protein) on TEHM/MS of PFAS. No significant association was observed between TEHM/MS and the albumin binding affinity of the compounds (p = 0.601), but TEHM/MS was significantly negatively correlated with the logarithmic octanol-water partition coefficients (r2 = 0.853, p = 0.001), the logarithmic membrane-water partition coefficients (r2 = 0.679, p = 0.012), and the carbohydrate contents in human milk. The effect of carbohydrate was further confirmed using in vitro tests. The negative associations between TEHM/MS and hydrophobicity, membrane passive permeability, and the carbohydrate content in human milk consistently indicated that passive diffusion through the paracellular route might be the main transfer pathway for PFOS and Cl-PFESAs from blood to milk in humans."

To better predict human exposure to MMHg, it is important to understand the trophic transfer of MMHg in the global marine food webs, which remains largely unknown, especially in the upper trophic level (TL) biota that is more directly relevant to human exposure. In this study, we couple a fish ecological model and an ocean methylmercury model to explore the influencing factors and mechanisms of MMHg transfer in marine fish food webs. Our results show that available MMHg in the zooplankton strongly determines the MMHg in fish. Medium-sized fish are critical intermediaries that transfer more than 70% of the MMHg circulating in food webs. Grazing is the main factor to control MMHg concentrations in different size categories of fish. Feeding interactions affected by ecosystem structures determine the degree of MMHg biomagnification. We estimate a total of 6.1 metric tons of MMHg potentially digested by the global population per year through marine fish consumption. The model provides a useful tool to quantify human exposure to MMHg through marine fish consumption and thus fills a critical gap in the effectiveness evaluation of the convention."

Our study used molecular techniques to elucidate N2O production characteristics and mechanisms in the soil profile (0-60 cm) during summer fallow, rice cropping, and winter fallow periods. The results pointed out that biotic processes dominated N2O production (72.2-100%) and N2O from the tillage layer accounted for 91.0-98.5% of total N2O in the soil profile. Heterotrophic denitrification (HD) was the main process generating N2O, contributing between 53.4 and 96.6%, the remainder being due to ammonia oxidation pathways, which was further confirmed by metagenomics and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. Nitrifier denitrification (ND) was an important N2O production source, contributing 0- 46.6% of total N2O production, which showed similar trends with N2O emissions. Among physicochemical and biological factors, ammonium content and the ratio of total organic matter to nitrate were the main driving factors affecting the contribution ratios of the ammonia oxidation pathways and HD pathway, respectively. Moisture content and pH affect norC-carrying Spirochetes and thus the N2O production rate. These findings confirm the importance of ND to N2O production and help to elucidate the impact of anthropogenic activities, including tillage, fertilization, and irrigation, on N2O production."

Here, a new type of nanosilica fungicide was proposed and demonstrated to control late blight by inducing intracellular peroxidation damage to Phytophthora infestans, the pathogen associated with potato late blight. Results indicated that the structural features of different silica nanoparticles were largely responsible for their antimicrobial activities. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity with a 98.02% inhibition rate of P. infestans, causing oxidative stress responses and cell structure damage in P. infestans. For the first time, MSNs were found to selectively induce spontaneous excess production of intracellular reactive oxygen species in pathogenic cells, including hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), superoxide radicals (center dot O2-), and singlet oxygen (1O2), leading to peroxidation damage in P. infestans. The effectiveness of MSNs was further tested in the pot experiments as well as leaf and tuber infection, and successful control of potato late blight was achieved with high plant compatibility and safety. This work provides new insights into the antimicrobial mechanism of nanosilica and highlights the use of nanoparticles for controlling late blight with green and highly efficient nanofungicides."

In this study, the abundance and composition of AOM communities were investigated in full-scale biofilters at 14 facilities across North America and in pilot-scale biofilters operated for 18 months at a full-scale water treatment plant. In general, the relative abundance of AOM in most full-scale biofilters and in the pilot-scale biofilters was as follows: AOB > comammox Nitrospira > AOA. The abundance of AOB in the pilot-scale biofilters increased with increasing influent ammonia concentration and decreasing temperature, whereas AOA and comammox Nitrospira exhibited no correlations with these parameters. The biofilters affected AOM abundance in the water passing through the filters via collecting and shedding but exhibited a minor influence on the composition of AOB and Nitrospira sublineage II communities in the filtrate. Overall, this study highlights the relative importance of AOB and comammox Nitrospira compared to AOA in biofilters and the influence of filter influent water quality on AOM in biofilters and their release into the filtrate."

However, isotopic and molecular mechanisms underlying N2O production pathways under elevated nitrogen concentration remain poorly understood. Here we used microbial inhibition, isotope mass balance, and molecular approaches to investigate N2O production mechanisms in estuarine and coastal sediments through a series of anoxic incubations. Site preference of the N2O molecule increased due to increasing nitrate concentration, suggesting the changes in N2O production pathways. Enhanced N2O production under high nitrate concentration was not mediated by bacterial denitrification, but instead was mainly regulated by fungal denitrification. Elevated nitrate concentration increased the contribution of fungal denitrification to N2O production by 11-25%, whereas it decreased bacterial N2O production by 16-33%. Chemodenitrification was also enhanced by high nitrate concentration, contributing to 13-28% of N2O production. Elevated nitrate concentration significantly mediated nirK-type denitrifiers structure and abundance, which are the keystone taxa driving N2O production. Collectively, these results suggest that increasing nitrate concentration can shift N2O production pathways from bacterial to fungal and chemodenitrification, which are mainly responsible for the enhanced N2O production and have widespread implications for N2O projections under ongoing nitrogen pollution in estuarine and coastal ecosystems."

Here, we present a high-throughput, data-driven approach that will aid in estimating occupational exposure using a database of over 1.5 million observations of chemical concentrations in U.S. workplace air samples. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model that uses industry type and the physicochemical properties of a substance to predict the distribution of workplace air concentrations. This model substantially outperforms a null model when predicting whether a substance will be detected in an air sample, and if so at what concentration, with 75.9% classification accuracy and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.00 log10 mg m-3 when applied to a held-out test set of substances. This modeling framework can be used to predict air concentration distributions for new substances, which we demonstrate by making predictions for 5587 new substance-by-workplace-type pairs reported in the US EPA's Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) industrial use database.

Control strategies for pre-formed DBPs before final disinfection, especially for currently nonregulated although highly toxic DBP species, are not yet established. This study evaluated the biodegradation potential of pre-formed DBPs, including haloacetonitriles (HANs), haloacetamides (HAMs), and haloacetaldehydes (HALs), during biofiltration with sand, anthracite, and biological activated carbon of three wastewater effluents under potable reuse conditions. Up to 90%+ removal of di-and trihalogenated HANs, HAMs, and HALs was observed, and removal was associated with active heterotrophic biomass and removal of biodegradable organic carbon. Unlike the microbial dehalogenation pathway of haloacetic acids (HAAs), removal of HANs and HAMs appeared to result from a biologically mediated hydrolysis pathway (i.e., HANs to HAMs and HAAs) that may be prone to inhibition. After prechlorination, biofiltration effectively controlled pre-formed DBP concentrations (e.g., from 271 mu g/L to as low as 22 mu g/L in total) and DBP-associated calculated toxicity (e.g., 96%+ reduction). Abiotic residual adsorption capacity in biological activated carbon media was important for controlling trihalomethanes.

Here, we use real-time, molecular measurements of both the gas and particle phase to provide a mechanistic understanding of the effect of RH on the partitioning of biogenic oxidized organic molecules (from alpha-pinene and isoprene) at low temperatures (243 and 263 K) at the CLOUD chamber at CERN. We observe increases in SOA mass of 45 and 85% with increasing RH from 10-20 to 60-80% at 243 and 263 K, respectively, and attribute it to the increased partitioning of semivolatile compounds. At 263 K, we measure an increase of a factor 2-4 in the concentration of C10H16O2-3, while the particle-phase concentrations of low-volatility species, such as C10H16O6-8, remain almost constant. This results in a substantial shift in the chemical composition and volatility distribution toward less oxygenated and more volatile species at higher RH (e.g., at 263 K, O/C ratio = 0.55 and 0.40, at RH = 10 and 80%, respectively). By modeling particle growth using an aerosol growth model, which accounts for kinetic limitations, we can explain the enhancement in the semi-volatile fraction through the complementary effect of decreased compound activity and increased bulk-phase diffusivity. Our results highlight the importance of particle water content as a diluting agent and a plasticizer for organic aerosol growth."

In total, 15 DBPs were tentatively identified for the first time as haloacetonitrilesulfonic acids, haloacetamidesulfonic acids, and haloacetaldehydesulfonic acids. Cysteine, glutathione, and p- phenolsulfonic acid were found as precursors during lab-scale chlorination, with cysteine providing the highest yield. A mixture of the labeled analogues of these DBPs was prepared by chlorination of 13C3-15N-cysteine and analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for structural confirmation and quantification. A total of 6 drinking water treatment plants utilizing various source waters and treatment trains produced sulfonated DBPs upon disinfection. Those were widespread in the tap water of 8 cities across Europe, with estimated concentrations up to 50 and 800 ng/L for total haloacetonitrilesulfonic acids and haloacetaldehydesulfonic acids, respectively. Up to 850 ng/L haloacetonitrilesulfonic acids were found in 3 public swimming pools.

Nevertheless, the potential neurotoxicity of 6-PPDQ after long-term exposure and the underlying mechanism are largely unclear. In Caenorhabditis elegans, we here observed that 0.1-10 mu g/L of 6-PPDQ caused several forms of abnormal locomotion behaviors. Meanwhile, the neurodegeneration of D-type motor neurons was observed in 10 mu g/L of 6-PPDQ-exposed nematodes. The observed neurodegeneration was associated with the activation of the Ca2+ channel DEG-3-mediated signaling cascade. In this signaling cascade, expressions of deg-3, unc-68, itr-1, crt-1, clp-1, and tra-3 were increased by 10 mu g/L of 6-PPDQ. Moreover, among genes encoding neuronal signals required for the control of stress response, expressions of jnk-1 and dbl-1 were decreased by 0.1-10 mu g/L of 6PPDQ, and expressions of daf-7 and glb-10 were decreased by 10 mu g/L of 6-PPDQ. RNAi of jnk-1, dbl-1, daf-7, and glb-10 resulted in the susceptibility to 6-PPDQ toxicity in decreasing locomotory ability and in inducing neurodegeneration, suggesting that JNK-1, DBL-1, DAF-7, and GLB-10 were also required for the induction of 6-PPDQ neurotoxicity.

Lightning is the dominant source of upper tropospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are precursors for ozone and hydroxyl radicals. In this study, we combine the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) with Vaisala Global Light-ning Dataset 360 to evaluate lightning NO2 (LNO2) production in the Arctic. By analyzing consecutive TROPOMI NO2 observations, we determine the lifetime and production efficiency of LNO2 during the summers of 2019-2021. Our results show that the LNO2 production efficiency over the ocean is similar to 6 times higher than over continental regions. Additionally, we find that a higher LNO2 production efficiency is often correlated with lower lightning rates. The summertime lightning NOx emission in the Arctic (north of 70 degrees N) is estimated to be 219 +/- 116 Mg of N, which is equal to 5% of anthropogenic NOx emissions. However, for the span of a few hours, the Arctic LNO2 density can even be comparable to anthropogenic NO2 emissions in the region. These new findings suggest that LNO2 can play an important role in the upper-troposphere/lower-stratosphere atmospheric chemical processes in the Arctic, particularly during the summer."

Current lithium recovery methods from spent T-LIBs mainly concentrated on chemical leaching methods. However, chemical leaching relying on the additional acid seriously threatens the global environment and nonselective leaching also leads to low Li recovery purity. Here, we first reported a direct electro-oxidation method for lithium leaching from spent T-LIBs (Li0.8Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2); 95.02% of Li in the spent T-LIBs was leached under 2.5 V in 3 h. Meanwhile, nearly 100% Li recovery purity was also achieved, attributed to no other metal leaching and additional agents. We also clarified the relationship between lithium leaching and other metals during the electro-oxidation of spent T-LIBs. Under the optimized voltage, Ni and O maintain the electroneutrality in the structure assisting Li leaching, while Co and Mn maintain their valence states. A direct electro-oxidation Li leaching approach achieves high Li recovery purity and meanwhile overcomes the secondary pollution problem."

However, the spatiotemporal characteristics of air pollution, the contribution of various factors to them, and the resultant health impacts have yet to be evaluated comprehensively. This study integrates machine learning (random forest) into LUR modeling (LURF) with intensive evaluations to develop high spatiotemporal resolution prediction models to estimate daily and diurnal PM2.5 and NO2 in Seoul, South Korea, at the spatial resolution of 500 m for a year (2019) and to then evaluate the contribution of driving factors and quantify the resultant premature mortality. Our results show that incorporating the random forest algorithm into our LUR model improves the model performance. Meteorological conditions have a great influence on daily models, while land-use factors play important roles in diurnal models. Our health assessment using dynamic population data estimates that PM2.5 and NO2 pollution, when combined, causes a total of 11,183 (95% CI: 5837-16,354) premature mortalities in Seoul in 2019, of which 64.9% are due to PM2.5, while the remaining are attributable to NO2. The air pollution-attributable health impacts in Seoul are largely caused by cardiovascular diseases including stroke. This study pinpoints the significant spatiotemporal variations and health impact of PM2.5 and NO2 in Seoul, providing essential data for epidemiological research and air quality management."

We propose a new acellular analytical strategy, the 'Thiol Reactome', to identify thiol-reactive DBPs by employing a thiol probe and nontargeted mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Disinfected/oxidized water samples had reduced cellular oxidative stress responses of 46 +/- 23% in Nrf2 reporter cells when preincubated with glutathione (GSH). This supports thiol-reactive DBPs as the predominant drivers of oxidative stress. This method was benchmarked using seven classes of DBPs including haloacetonitriles, which preferentially reacted with GSH via substitution or addition depending on the number of halogens present. The method was then applied to chemically disinfected/ oxidized waters, and 181 tentative DBP-GSH reaction products were detected. The formulas of 24 high abundance DBP-GSH adducts were predicted, among which nitrogenous-DBPs (11) and unsaturated carbonyls (4) were the predominant compound classes. Two major unsaturated carbonyl-GSH adducts, GSH-acrolein and GSH-acrylic acid, were confirmed by their authentic standards. These two adducts were unexpectedly formed from larger native DBPs when reacting with GSH. This study demonstrated the Thiol Reactome as an effective acellular assay to precisely identify and broadly capture toxic DBPs from water mixtures."

Its biodegradation generally leads to the accumulation of guanylurea in the environment, but the microorganisms and mechanisms involved in this process remain elusive. Here, Aminobacter sp. strain NyZ550 was isolated and characterized for its ability to grow on metformin as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy under oxic conditions. This isolate also assimilated a variety of nitrogenous compounds, including dimethylamine. Hydrolysis of metformin by strain NyZ550 was accompanied by a stoichiometric accumulation of guanylurea as a dead-end product. Based on ion chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and comparative transcriptomic analyses, dimethylamine was identified as an additional hydrolytic product supporting the growth of the strain. Notably, a microbial mixture consisting of strain NyZ550 and an engineered Pseudomonas putida PaW340 expressing a guanylurea hydrolase was constructed for complete elimination of metformin and its persistent product guanylurea. Overall, our results not only provide new insights into the metformin biodegradation pathway, leading to the commonly observed accumulation of guanylurea in the environment, but also open doors for the complete degradation of the new pollutant metformin."

So far, however, a respective baseline narcosis reference has been lacking to predict narcosis-level toxicity and to identify excess-toxic compounds and associated mechanisms of action. Employing 22 organic narcotics that cover 7.2 units of their log Kow (octanol/ water partition coefficient) from -1.20 to 6.03, a baseline narcosis model has been derived for a glass-vial 96-h growth inhibition test with C. elegans, both without and with correction for compound loss through volatilization and sorption. The resultant effective concentrations yielding 50% growth inhibition, EC50, vary by 6.4 log units from 5.04 center dot 10-1 to 1.90 center dot 10-7 mol/L (exposure corrected). Application of the new model is illustrated through sensing the toxicity enhancement (Te) of four Michael-acceptor carbonyls driven by their reactive mode of action. Moreover, narcosis-level predicted vs experimental EC50 of two alpha,beta-unsaturated alcohols demonstrate the biotransformation capability of C. elegans regarding ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase). The discussion includes narcosis-level and excess-toxicity doses (critical body burdens) as well as chemical activities A50 (at the EC50) as compared to fish, daphnids, ciliates, bacteria, zebrafish embryo, and cell lines.

Water samples were collected from showers in buildings supplied with chlorinated groundwater, untreated groundwater, and chloraminated surface water. The building supplied with chlorinated groundwater generally had the lowest bacterial concentrations across all sites (ranging from below quantification limit to 5.2 log copies/L). For buildings supplied with untreated groundwater, bacterial concentrations (5.0 to 7.6 log copies/L) and microbial community diversity index (ACE) values were consistent throughout sampling. Nontuberculous mycobac-teria (NTM) and Legionella pneumophila were not detected in any groundwater-supplied buildings. Total bacteria, Legionella spp., and NTM were abundant in the surface water-supplied buildings following long-term stagnation (up to 7.6, 6.2, and 7.6 log copies/L, respectively). Flushing decreased these concentrations by similar to 1 to >4 log units and reduced microbial community diversity, but the communities largely recovered within a week of post-flush stagnation. The results suggest that buildings supplied with disinfected surface water are more likely than buildings supplied with treated or untreated groundwater to experience deleterious changes in microbiological water quality during stagnation and that the water quality improvements from flushing with chloraminated water, while substantial, are short-lived."

Much graphite is imported, raising supply chain risks. It is therefore imperative to characterize graphite's sources and sinks. Accordingly, we present the first material flow analysis for natural and synthetic graphite in the U.S. The analysis (for 2018) begins with processed graphite trade and includes graphite production, graphite product trade, manufacturing of end products, end product use, and waste management. It considers 11 end-use applications for graphite, two waste management stages, and three recycling pathways. In 2018, 354 thousand tonnes (kt) of processed graphite were consumed in the U.S., including 60 kt natural graphite and 294 kt synthetic graphite. 145 kt of graphite were traded. Refractories and foundries consumed 56% of natural graphite; 42% of synthetic graphite went into making graphite electrodes. Batteries accounted for 10 and 5% of natural and synthetic graphite consumption, respectively; 78% of total graphite used dissipated into the environment; 22% reached the waste disposal stage of which 71% was landfilled and 29% was recycled; and 59 kt of graphite accumulated in in-use stocks.

Within aquatic ecosystems, the stream periphyton can transiently store bioavailable P through uptake and incorporation into biomass during subscouring and baseflow conditions. However, the capacity of stream periphyton to respond to dynamic P concentrations, which are ubiquitous in streams, is largely unknown. Our study used artificial streams to impose short periods (48 h) of high SRP concentration on stream periphyton acclimated to P scarcity. We examined periphyton P content and speciation through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to elucidate the intracellular storage and transformation of P taken up across a gradient of transiently elevated SRP availabilities. Our study demonstrates that the stream periphyton not only takes up significant quantities of P following a 48-h high P pulse but also sustains supplemental growth over extended periods of time (10 days), following the reestablishment of P scarcity by efficiently assimilating P stored as polyphosphates into functional biomass (i.e., phospho-monoesters and phospho-diesters). Although P uptake and intracellular storage approached an upper limit across the experimentally imposed SRP pulse gradient, our findings demonstrate the previously underappreciated extent to which the periphyton can modulate the timing and magnitude of P delivery from streams. Further elucidating these intricacies in the transient storage potential of periphyton highlights opportunities to enhance the predictive capacity of watershed nutrient models and potentially improve watershed P management."

Middle-age and older males and menopausal women completed the collection of basic information, blood samples, and clinical examinations.

Multiple linear regression models were applied to quantify the associations and interactions while controlling for confounders, and a restricted cubic spline function estimated the corresponding dose-response curves of the relationships. Overall, KDM-biological age acceleration was associated with PM2.5 component exposure over the preceding year in both males and females, with calcium [females: 0.795 (95% CI: 0.451, 1.138); males: 0.712 (95% CI: 0.389, 1.034)], arsenic [females: 0.770 (95% CI: 0.641, 0.899); males: 0.661 (95% CI: 0.532, 0.791)], and copper [females: 0.401 (95% CI: 0.158, 0.644); males: 0.379 (95% CI: 0.122, 0.636)] having greater estimates of the effect than total PM2.5 mass. Additionally, we observed that the associations of specific PM2.5 components with aging were lower in the higher sex hormone scenario.

It is unclear whether residual chlorine in tap water can react with APM to form disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Therefore, we investigated the formation of DBPs from the reaction of APM with residual chlorine in authentic tap water. APM and a commercial sweetener (CS) packet containing APM were studied under authentic and simulated tap water conditions. Eight chlorinated products of APM were detected using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS). These new chloro-products were tentatively identified based on accurate masses, isotopic patterns of 35,37Cl, and MS/MS spectra. Furthermore, we identified APM as a precursor to 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ). DCBQ significantly increased to 2.3-12 ng/L with the addition of APM or CS in tap waters collected from different locations compared to 1.4-1.8 ng/L in the same tap water samples without sweetener. DCBQ and two of the chlorinated transformation products were identified in cold prepared tea containing APM. DCBQ formation was eliminated when the residual chlorine in tap water was reduced by ascorbic acid or boiling prior to the addition of APM or CS. This study found that eight new DBPs and DCBQ were produced by the reactions of residual chlorine with APM and CS. These findings show an unintended exposure source of emerging DBPs via APM sweetened beverages."	"[Wawryk, Nicholas J. P.; Huang, Guang; Craven, Caley; Qiu, Junlang; Blackstock, Lindsay K.

However, the composting process is also a source of greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions. Researchers, regulators, and policy decision-makers all rely on emissions estimates to develop local emissions inventories and weigh competing waste diversion options, yet reported emission factors are difficult to interpret and highly variable. This review explores the impacts of waste characteristics, pretreatment processes, and composting conditions on CO2, CH4, N2O, NH3, and VOC emissions by critically reviewing and analyzing 388 emission factors from 46 studies. The values reported to date suggest that CH4 is the single largest contributor to 100-year global warming potential (GWP100) for yard waste composting, comprising approximately 80% of the total GWP100. For nitrogen-rich wastes including manure, mixed municipal organic waste, and wastewater treatment sludge, N2O is the largest contributor to GWP100, accounting for half to as much as 90% of the total GWP100. If waste is anaerobically digested prior to composting, N2O, NH3, and VOC emissions tend to decrease relative to composting the untreated waste. Effective pile management and aeration are key to minimizing CH4 emissions. However, forced aeration can increase NH3 emissions in some cases."

The environments of three fringing reef regions along the south coast of Sanya City, Hainan Province of China, were polluted by microplastics (for example, microplastic concentrations in the seawater ranged from 3.3 to 46.6 particles L-1), resulting in microplastic accumulation in P. pukoensis (0.4-2.4 particles cm-2). The accumulation of microplastics was negatively correlated to algal symbiont density in the corals but not to caspase3 activities in the two symbiotic partners, demonstrating that P. pukoensis could tolerate accumulated microplastics despite the decrease of algal symbiont density. Furthermore, results from the carbon stable isotope and cellular energy allocation assay indicated that P. pukoensis obtained energy availability (mainly as lipid reserves) using the switch between heterotrophy and autotrophy to maintain energy balance and cope with accumulated microplastics.

Here, analysis of genomic and transcriptomic changes upon a PM2.5 exposure-induced human bronchial epithelial cell-based malignant transformed cell model in vitro showed that PM2.5 exposure led to APOBEC mutational signatures and transcriptional activation of APOBEC3B along with other potential oncogenes. Moreover, by analyzing mutational profiles of 1117 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) from patients across four different geographic regions, we observed a significantly higher prevalence of APOBEC mutational signatures in non-smoking NSCLCs than smoking in the Chinese cohorts, but this difference was not observed in TCGA or Singapore cohorts. We further validated this association by showing that the PM2.5 exposure-induced transcriptional pattern was significantly enriched in Chinese NSCLC patients compared with other geographic regions. Finally, our results showed that PM2.5 exposure activated the DNA damage repair pathway. Overall, here we report a previously uncharacterized association between PM2.5 and APOBEC activation, revealing a potential molecular mechanism of PM2.5 exposure and lung cancer."

They thus appear to be a stopgap solution despite their potential contribution to circular water management. Low-maintenance but inaccurate soft sensors are emerging that address this concern. However, how their inaccuracy impacts the catchment-wide treatment performance of a system of many OSTs has not been quantified. We develop a stochastic model to estimate catchment wide OST performances with a Monte Carlo simulation. In our study, soft sensors with a 70% accuracy improved the treatment performance from 66% of the time functional to 98%. Soft sensors optimized for specificity, indicating the true negative rate, improve the system performance, while sensors optimized for sensitivity, indicating the true positive rate, quantify the treatment performance more accurately. This new insight leads us to suggest programming two soft sensors in practical settings with the same hardware sensor data as input: one soft sensor geared to high specificity for maintenance scheduling and one geared to high sensitivity for performance quantification.

Measurements included particulate air pollutants (PM2.5, black carbon [BC], ultrafine particles [UFPs]), volatile organic compounds, and nitrogen dioxide. We measured participants' heart rate variability (HRV), saliva cortisol, and cognitive function. On average, CAF reduced concentrations of UFPs by 26,232 (95%CI: 11,734, 40,730) n/cm3, PM2.5 by 6 (95%CI: 5, 8)mu g/m3, and BC by 1348 (95%CI: 1042, 1654) ng/m3, or 28, 30, and 32%, respectively. Each IQR increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 28% (95%CI: 2, 60) increase in high-frequency power HRV at the end of the commute and a 22% (95%CI: 7, 39) increase 45 min afterward. IQR increases in UFPs were associated with increased saliva cortisol in women during the commute (18% [95%CI: 0, 40]). IQR increases in UFPs were associated with strong switching costs (19% [95%CI: 2, 39]), indicating a reduced capacity for multitasking, and PM2.5 was associated with increased reaction latency, indicating slower responses (5% [95%CI: 1, 10]).

Herein, a swellable array adsorption strategy was proposed to realize the synergistic adsorption of toluene and formaldehyde on the flexible double hypercross-linked polymers (FD-HCPs). FD-HCPs exhibited multiple adsorption sites awarded by a hydrophobic benzene ring/pyrrole ring and a hydrophilic hydroxyl structural unit. The array benzene ring, hydroxyl, and pyrrole N sites in FD-HCPs effectively captured toluene and formaldehyde molecules through pi-pi conjugation and electrostatic interaction and weakened their mutual competitive adsorption. Interestingly, the strong binding force of toluene molecules to the skeleton deformed the pore structure of FD-HCPs and generated new adsorption microenvironments for the other adsorbate. This behavior significantly improved the adsorption capacity of FD-HCPs for toluene and formaldehyde by 20% under multiple VOCs. Moreover, the pyrrole group in FD-HCPs greatly hindered H2O molecule diffusion in the pore, thus efficiently weakening the competitive adsorption of H2O toward VOCs. These fascinating properties enabled FD-HCPs to achieve synergistic adsorption for multicomponent VOC vapor under a highly humid environment and overcame single-species VOC adsorption properties on state-of-the-art porous adsorbents. This work provides the practical feasibility of synergistic adsorption to remove complex VOCs in real-world environments."

Given China's entrance into the new stage of economic development, an updated study on the largest CO2 emitter's domestic emission distribution is needed for effective and coordinated global CO2 mitigation planning. We discovered that domestic CO2 emissions in China are increasingly polarized for the 2007-2017 period. Specifically, the domestically exported CO2 emissions from the less developed and more polluting northwest region to the rest of China has drastically increased from 165 Mt in 2007 to 230 Mt in 2017. We attribute the polarizing trend to the simultaneous industrial upgrading of all regions and the persistent disparity in the development and emission decoupling of China's regions. We also noted that CO2 emissions exported from China to the rest of the world has decreased by 41% from 2007 to 2017, with other developing countries filling up the vacancy. As this trend is set to intensify, we intend to send an alarm message to policy makers to devise and initiate actions and avoid the continuation of pollution migration."

Multi-element compound-specific isotope analysis bears the potential to elucidate the biodegradation pathways of 1,2-DBA in the environment, which is crucial information to assess its fate in contaminated sites. This study investigates for the first time dual C- Br isotope fractionation during in vivo biodegradation of 1,2-DBA by two anaerobic enrichment cultures containing organohaliderespiring bacteria (i.e., either Dehalococcoides or Dehalogenimonas). Different epsilon bulk C values (-1.8 +/- 0.2 and -19.2 +/- 3.5 parts per thousand, respectively) were obtained, whereas their respective epsilon bulk Br values were lower and similar to each other (-1.22 +/- 0.08 and -1.2 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand), leading to distinctly different trends (?C-Br = Delta delta 13C/Delta delta 81Br approximate to epsilon bulk C /epsilon bulk Br ) in a dual C-Br isotope plot (1.4 +/- 0.2 and 12 +/- 4, respectively). These results suggest the occurrence of different underlying reaction mechanisms during enzymatic 1,2-DBA transformation, that is, concerted dihaloelimination and nucleophilic substitution (SN2-reaction). The strongly pathway-dependent ?C-Br values illustrate the potential of this approach to elucidate the reaction mechanism of 1,2-DBA in the field and to select appropriate epsilon bulkC values for quantification of biodegradation. The results of this study provide valuable information for future biodegradation studies of 1,2-DBA in contaminated sites."

Based on the analysis of environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics in global freshwater systems, herein, we employed aggregated-induced emission (AIE) microplastic fluorogens and imaged and quantified the bioaccumulation of differentially charged micro- (20 mu m)/ nano- (200 nm) plastics (MNPs) in zooplankton Daphnia magna. We found that all particles of different sizes and charges were readily ingested, especially larger-sized and positively charged MNPs, with over 50% of the ingested particles accumulating in the gut. Bioaccumulation of MNPs reached 50% of steady-state condition within 1 h. The presence of algae inhibited the ingestion and depuration of MNPs. To further demonstrate the effects of such accumulation on gut health, we further applied the AIE probes for visualizing the pH and esterase in the digestive tract, as well as the gut inflammation. An accumulation of MNPs in D. magna significantly and rapidly induced the acidification of gut pH while inducing esterase activity. The NPs apparently induced gut inflammation in contrast to the MPs, demonstrating the size-dependent effects on oxidative stress. Our results highlighted that MNP exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations perturbed the microenvironments of zooplankton guts, which may significantly affect their digestion and assimilation of food materials as well as contaminant uptake."

However, the limited understanding of the overall effect of interspecific interactions on remediation efficacy hinders its application. Here, the effects of multispecies growth and biofilm formation on Cd immobilization were explored from direct and multiple interactions through random combinations of two or three rhizosphere bacteria. In monocultures, Cd stress resulted in an average decrease in planktonic biomass of 26%, but through cooperation, the decrease was attenuated in dual (21%) and triple cultures (13%), possibly involving an increase in surface polysaccharides. More than 65% of the co-cultures exhibited induction of biofilm formation under Cd stress, which further enhanced the role of biofilms in Cd immobilization. Notably, excellent biofilm-forming ability or extensive social induction makes Pseudomonas putida and Brevundimonas diminuta stand out in multispecies biofilm formation and Cd immobilization. These two core species significantly increase the colonization of soil microorganisms on rice roots compared to the control, resulting in a 40% decrease in Cd uptake by rice. Our study enhances the understanding of bacterial interactions under Cd stress and provides a novel strategy for adjusting beneficial soil consortia for heavymetal remediation."

After influence from continental air, they are typically composed of Na+, Cl-, NH4+, and SO42- and organics. Analogous particle systems are often studied in laboratory settings by atomizing and drying particles from a solution. Here, we present evidence that such laboratory studies may be consistently biased in that they neglect losses of solutes to the gas phase. We present experimental evidence from a hygroscopic tandem differential mobility analyzer and an aerosol mass spectrometer, further supported by thermodynamic modeling. We show that, at normally prevailing laboratory aerosol mass concentrations, for mixtures of NaCl and (NH4)2SO4, a significant portion of the Cl- and NH4+ ions are lost to the gas phase, in some cases, leaving mainly Na2SO4 in the dry particles. Not considering losses of solutes to the gas phase during experimental studies will likely result in misinterpretation of the data. One example of such data is that from particle water uptake experiments. This may bias the explanatory models constructed from the data and introduce errors inte predictions made by air quality or climate models."

However, the pore clogging potentially limits the mass transfer process inside the electrode due to the unreasonable structure design and long-term operation. The investigation of mass transport behavior in the porous scaffolds is of great significance for designing the electrode structure and optimizing bioelectrochemical system performance. To in situ characterize the mass transport behavior in the orderly pore structure, model electrodes with 100 copper wires (10 x 10) are constructed to imitate a three-dimensional porous structure (pore size: similar to 150 mu m) commonly employed in bioelectrodes. The poor proton effective diffusion coefficient solidly demonstrates that the mass transport inside the three-dimensional porous electrode is critically inhibited, leading not only to a progressive change and sparse biomass in the biofilm development process but also to biofilm acidification due to serious proton accumulation. It finally results in sluggish bacterial metabolic activity and a decreased electrocatalytic capacity. The interior space of porous electrodes cannot be adequately utilized, resulting in the inability to fully exploit the advantages of their abundant surface area. Consequently, the construction of gradient porous electrodes with small inner and large outer pores to enhance mass transport is a feasible proposal for enhancing performance. The proposed methodology of establishing model electrodes combined with the in situ detection technique within porous electrodes is crucial for acquiring various types of physicochemical information inside the bioelectrode, such as biofilm growth situation, biochemical reaction conditions, as well as mass transfer characteristics.

At low levels of saturation (high flow rate) with the wetting liquid mainly present as pendular rings, the colloids can aggregate at the liquid filaments in small-grain packings and are uniformly distributed in large-grain packings. Through theoretical analysis of the pendular ring geometry, we elucidate the mechanism responsible for the strong dependence of colloid clogging behavior on solid grain size. Our results further demonstrate that even at dilute concentrations, colloids can alter the flow paths and the wetting fluid topology, suggesting a strong two-way coupling dynamics between immiscible two-phase flow and colloid transport and calling for improved predictive models to incorporate the overlooked clogging behavior."

Foliage of three species, namely, white willow (Salix alba L.), black poplar (Populus nigra L.), and black alder (Alnus glutinosa L.), were sampled to evaluate seasonal and annual variations in PFAS concentrations. The results of the phytoscreening clearly indicated species and specific differences, with the highest PFAS sum concentrations Sigma(23) observed in October for white willow (0-1800 mu g kg(-1)), followed by black poplar (6.7-32 mu g kg(-1)) and black alder (0-13 mu g kg(-1)). The bulk substances in leaves were highly mobile short-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs). In contrast, the PFAS composition in soil was dominated by long-chain PFCAs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), as a result of the lower mobility with Sigma(23)PFAS ranging between 0.18 and 26 mu g L-1 (eluate) and between 66 and 420 mu g kg(-1) (solid). However, the PFAS composition in groundwater was comparable to the spectrum observed in leaves. Spatial interpolations of PFAS in groundwater and foliage correspond well and demonstrate the successful application of phytoscreening to detect and delineate the impact of the studied PFAS on groundwater."

However, the dynamics of soil methane-cycling microbiomes in rewetted peatlands during summer drought are still poorly characterized. Using a quantitative metatranscriptomic approach, we investigated the changes in the transcript abundances of methanogen and methanotroph rRNA, as well as mcrA and pmoA mRNA before, during, and after the 2018 summer drought in a coastal and a percolation fen in northern Germany. Drought changed the community structure of methane-cycling microbiomes and decreased the CH4 fluxes as well as the rRNA and mRNA transcript abundances of methanogens and methanotrophs, but they showed no recovery or increase after the drought ended. The rRNA transcript abundance of methanogens was not correlated with CH4 fluxes in both fens. In the percolation fen, however, the mcrA transcript abundance showed a positive and significant correlation with CH4 fluxes. Importantly, when integrating pmoA abundance, a stronger correlation was observed between CH4 fluxes and mcrA/pmoA, suggesting that relationships between methanogens and methanotrophs are the key determinant of CH4 turnover. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the methane-cycling microbiome feedbacks to drought events in rewetted peatlands."

Thus, aiming to get the balance of simplifi-cation and accuracy, an occupant-centric prediction model of dynamic heating and cooling loads for urban community at energy planning stage with simplified calculation principles, reduced input parameters, improved simulation accuracy, and preserved characteristics of the individual building in the community was proposed. Based on the previously developed building envelope simplification model, internal heat gain modules and operating schedule modules were developed. After verifying the prediction accuracy of the model by comparison with EnergyPlus software, the model was applied to a typical university campus. Case study analysis shows that this model can accurately predict dynamic space heating and cooling loads of urban community with simplified inputs at energy planning stage, which provides theoretical support and convenience for optimizing the urban energy prediction model."

We profiled 56 elements by ICP-MS and used logistic regression, LASSO, BKMR, and GAM to identify colorectal cancer-relevant elements. A series of bio-chemical experiments were performed to demonstrate the cytotoxicity and the mechanisms of malignant transformation after metal exposure. Using an elementomics approach, we first found that the metal thallium (Tl) was positively correlated with many toxic metals and was associated with a significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer. Acute exposure to Tl induced cytotoxicity and cell death by accelerating the generation of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage. Chronic exposure to Tl led to the inhibition of cell death and thereby induced the malignant transformation of normal colon cells and xenograft tumor formation in nude mice. Furthermore, we describe the first identification of a significant metal quantitative trait locus for the novel colorectal cancer susceptibility locus rs1511625 near ATP13A3. Mechanistically, Tl increased the level of aberrant N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of ATP13A3 via the METLL3/ METTL14/ALKBH5-ATP13A3 axis to promote colorectal tumorigenesis. This study provides a basis for the development of public health strategies for reducing metal exposure among populations at high risk for colorectal cancer."

In the North Sea region, there is a long tradition to use beached fulmars as biomonitors for marine plastic pollution. Monitoring data revealed consistently lower plastic burdens in adult fulmars compared to younger age classes. Those findings were hypothesized to partly result from parental transfer of plastic to chicks. However, no prior study has examined this mechanism in fulmars by comparing plastic burdens in fledglings and older fulmars shortly after the chick-rearing period. Therefore, we investigated plastic ingestion in 39 fulmars from Kongsfjorden (Svalbard), including 21 fledglings and 18 older fulmars (adults/older immatures). We found that fledglings (50-60 days old) had significantly more plastic than older fulmars. While plastic was found in all fledglings, two older fulmars contained no and several older individuals barely any plastic. These findings supported that fulmar chicks from Svalbard get fed high quantities of plastic by their parents. Adverse effects of plastic on fulmars were indicated by one fragment that perforated the stomach and possibly one thread perforating the intestine. Negative correlations between plastic mass and body fat in fledglings and older fulmars were not significant."

Quantifying oxidizing triplet concentrations in ALW is difficult because 3C* probe loss can be inhibited by the high levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and copper in particle water, leading to an underestimate of triplet concen-trations. In addition, illuminated ALW contains high concen-trations of singlet molecular oxygen (1O2*), which can interfere with 3C* probes. Our overarching goal is to find a triplet probe that has low inhibition by DOM and Cu(II) and low sensitivity to 1O2*. To this end, we tested 12 potential probes from a variety of compound classes. Some probes are strongly inhibited by DOM, while others react rapidly with 1O2*. One of the probe candidates, (phenylthiol)acetic acid (PTA), seems well suited for ALW conditions, with mild inhibition and fast rate constants with triplets, but it also has weaknesses, including a pH-dependent reactivity. We evaluated the performance of both PTA and syringol (SYR) as triplet probes in aqueous extracts of particulate matter. While PTA is less sensitive to inhibition than SYR, it results in lower triplet concentrations, possibly because it is less reactive with weakly oxidizing triplets."

This study simulated seawater's tritium and carbon-14 pollution and analyzed the effects on the seawater and sediment microenvironments. Tritium and carbon-14 pollution primarily altered nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism in the seawater environment. Analysis by 16S rRNA sequencing showed changes in the relative abundance of microorganisms involved in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus metabolism and organic matter degradation in response to tritium and carbon-14 exposure. Metabonomics and metagenomic analysis showed that tritium and carbon-14 exposure interfered with gene expression involving nucleotide and amino acid metabolites, in agreement with the results seen for microbial community structure. Tritium and carbon-14 exposure also modulated the abundance of functional genes involved in carbohydrate, phosphorus, sulfur, and nitrogen metabolic pathways in sediments. Tritium and carbon-14 pollution in seawater adversely affected microbial diversity, metabolic processes, and the abundance of nutrient-cycling genes. These results provide valuable information for further evaluating the risks of tritium and carbon-14 in marine environments."

These injected fluids mix with the host rock formation and return to the surface as a complex wastewater containing salts, metals, and organic compounds, termed flowback and produced water (FPW). Previous research indicates that FPW is toxic to Daphnia magna (D. magna), impairing reproduction, molting, and maturation time; however, recovery from FPW has not been extensively studied. Species unable to recover have drastic impacts on populations on the ecological scale; thus, this study sought to understand if recovery from an acute 48 h FPW exposure was possible in the freshwater invertebrate, D. magna by using a combination of physiological and molecular analyses. FPW (0.75%) reduced reproduction by 30% and survivorship to 32% compared to controls. System-level quantitative proteomic analyses demonstrate extensive perturbation of metabolism and protein transport in both 0.25 and 0.75% FPW treatments after a 48 h FPW exposure. Collectively, our data indicate that D. magna are unable to recover from acute 48 h exposures to >= 0.25% FPW, as evidence of toxicity persists for at least 19 days post-exposure. This study highlights the importance of considering persisting effects following FPW remediation when modeling potential spill scenarios."

This study investigated the microstructure of a lead pipe, supplied with high-alkalinity tap water, in which the lead calcium apatite crystals were spherulitic having rounded and dumb-bell-shaped morphologies. XRD, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy showed that the lead pipe had a well-established inner layer of litharge; a middle layer containing lead calcium apatite spherulites, plumbonacrite, and some hydrocerussite; and an outer layer containing iron, lead, phosphorus, calcium, silicon, and aluminum. It was found that spherulitic lead calcium apatite could be grown in the laboratory by adding hydrocerussite to synthetic soft and hard water-containing phosphate, chloride, and citrate ions at pH 5.5 but not when the citrate was absent. This suggests that dissolved organic molecules might play a role in spherulite formation on lead water pipes.

In this study, a novel granulation model regulated by Epistylis spp. for highly enriched AnAOB was revealed for the first time. Notably, anammox granulation was achieved within 65 d of domestic wastewater treatment. The stalks of Epistylis spp. were found to act as the skeleton of granules and provide attachment points for bacterial colonization, and the expanded biomass layer in turn provided more area for the unstalked free-swimming zooids. Additionally, Epistylis spp. exerted much less predation stress on AnAOB than on nitrifying bacteria, and AnAOB tended to grow in aggregates in the interior of granules, thus favoring the growth and retention of AnAOB. Ultimately, the relative abundance of AnAOB reached up to a maximum of 8.2% in granules (doubling time of 9.9 d) compared to 1.1% in flocs (doubling time of 23.1 d), representing the most substantial disparity between granules and flocs.

However, the mechanisms by which Pi overload influences aquatic animals remain largely unexplored. In the present study, Pi supplementation increased the Pi content, inhibited lipid accumulation and lipogenesis, and stimulated lipolysis in the liver. Pi supplementation increased the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3 beta) at serine 9 (S9) but inhibited the phosphorylation of GSK3 alpha at tyrosine 279 (Y279), GSK3 beta at tyrosine 216 (Y216), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) at serine 84 (S84) and threonine 265 (T265). Pi supplementation also upregulated PPAR alpha protein expression and stimulated its transcriptional activity, thereby inducing lipolysis. Pi suppressed GSK3 beta activity and prevented GSK3 beta, but not GSK3 alpha, from interacting with PPAR alpha, which in turn alleviated PPAR alpha phosphorylation. GSK3 beta-induced phosphorylation of PPAR alpha was dependent on GSK3 beta S9 dephosphorylation rather than Y216 phosphorylation. Mechanistically, underphosphorylation of PPAR alpha mediated Pi-induced lipid degradation through transcriptionally activating adipose triglyceride lipase (atgl) and very long-chain-specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (acadvl). Collectively, our findings uncovered a new mechanism by which Pi facilitates lipolysis via the GSK3 beta-PPAR alpha pathway and highlighted the importance of S84 and T265 phosphorylation in PPAR alpha action."

The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of S. flexneri is a growing public health threat worldwide, while large-scale studies monitoring the longitudinal AMR trends of isolates remain scarce. Here, the AMR gene (ARG) profiles of 717 S. flexneri isolates from 1920 to 2020 worldwide were determined. The results showed that the average number of ARGs in isolates has increased significantly, from 19.2 +/- 2.4 before 1970 to 29.6 +/- 5.3 after 2010. In addition, mobile genetic elements were important contributors to ARGs in S. flexneri isolates. The results of the structural equation model showed that the human development index drove the consumption of antibiotics and indirectly promoted the antibiotic resistance. Finally, a machine learning algorithm was used to predict the antibiotic resistance risk of global terrestrial S. flexneri isolates and successfully map the antibiotic resistance threats in global land habitats with over 80% accuracy. Collectively, this study monitored the longitudinal AMR trends, quantitatively surveilled the health risk of S. flexneri AMR, and provided a theoretical basis for mitigating the threat of antibiotic resistance."

The SOA was generated by the dark ozonolysis of alpha- pinene, extracted into the water, and subjected to chemical aging by the OH. Bimolecular reaction rate coefficients (kOH) for the oxidation of terpenoic acids by the OH were measured using the relative rate method. The unaged SOA was dominated by the cyclobutyl-ring-retaining compounds, primarily cis- pinonic, cis-pinic, and hydroxy-pinonic acids. Aqueous oxidation by the OH resulted in the removal of early-stage products and dimers, including wellknown oligomers with MW = 358 and 368 Da. Furthermore, a 2-to 5-fold increase in the concentration of cyclobutyl-ring-opening products was observed, including terpenylic and diaterpenylic acids and diaterpenylic acid acetate as well as some of the newly identified OH aging markers. At the same time, results obtained from the kinetic box model showed a high degree of SOA fragmentation following the reaction with the OH, which indicates that non-radical reactions occurring during the evaporation of water likely contribute to the high yields of terpenoic aqSOAs reported previously. The estimated atmospheric lifetimes showed that in clouds, terpenoic acids react with the OH exclusively in the aqueous phase. Aqueous OH aging of the alpha-pinene SOA results in a 10% increase of the average O/C ratio and a 3-fold decrease in the average kOH value, which is likely to affect the cloud condensation nuclei activity of the aqSOA formed after the evaporation of water."

However, significant amounts of bisphenol S (BPS) and alternative color developers (up to 214 ??g/cm2) were present in thermal labels; their relative occurrence varied among stores.

Besides settling velocities and critical shear stress for erosion, only a few investigations aim at MPs' vertical concentration profile and the underlying theory required. Therefore, this paper's experiments investigate vertical concentration profiles of approximately spherical MP particles (d = 1-3 mm) with densities close to water (0.91-1.13 g/cm3) in flow channels, coupling them with fundamental theory for the first time. The experiments were conducted in a tiling flume (slope of 0-2.4%) at 67 and 80 mm water depth, with a turbulent flow, velocities ranging from 0.4 to 1.8 m/s, and turbulence kinetic energy from 0.002 to 0.08 m2/s2. The measured profiles confirm the assumption that the concentration profile shapes of settling plastics are similar to those of sediments and running reversed for buoyant plastics. Furthermore, the hypothesis of the Rouse formula's applicability for floating and sinking plastics could be confirmed for approximately uniform flows.

In this study, we compared exposures and load contributions to surface water from the discharge of three reuse waters (wastewater effluent, urban stormwater, and agricultural runoff). Results document substantial and varying organic-chemical contribu-tion to surface water from effluent discharges (e.g., disinfection byproducts [DBP], prescription pharmaceuticals, industrial/household chemicals), urban stormwater (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, nonprescription pharmaceuticals), and agricultural runoff (e.g., pesticides). Excluding DBPs, episodic storm-event organic concentrations and loads from urban stormwater were comparable to and often exceeded those of daily wastewater-effluent discharges. We also assessed if wastewater-effluent irrigation to corn resulted in measurable effects on organic-chemical concentrations in rain -induced agricultural runoff and harvested feedstock. Overall, the target-organic load of 491 g from wastewater-effluent irrigation to the study corn field during the 2019 growing season did not produce substantial dissolved organic-contaminant contributions in subsequent rain-induced runoff events. Out of the 140 detected organics in source wastewater-effluent irrigation, only imidacloprid and estrone had concentrations that resulted in observable differences between rain-induced agricultural runoff from the effluent -irrigated and nonirrigated corn fields. Analyses of pharmaceuticals and per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances in at-harvest corn-plant samples detected two prescription antibiotics, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, at concentrations of 36 and 70 ng/g, respectively, in effluent-irrigated corn-plant samples; no contaminants were detected in noneffluent irrigated corn-plant samples."

Polycarboxylate ligands may be present in some sites and are potentially capable of strong complexing interactions, thus increasing the solubility and mobility of 99Tc under environmentally relevant conditions. This work aimed to determine the impact of five organic complexing ligands [L = oxalate, phthalate, citrate, nitrilotriacetate (NTA), and ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA)] under anoxic, alkaline conditions (pH Pe. 9-13) on the solubility of technetium. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed that TcO2(am,hyd) remained the solubility-controlling solid phase in undersaturation solubility experiments. Ligands with maximum coordination numbers (CN) >= 3 (EDTA, NTA, and citrate) exhibited an increase in solubility from pH 9 to 11, while ligands with CN <= 2 (oxalate and phthalate) at all investigated pH and CN >= 3 at pH Pe. 13 were outcompeted by hydrolysis reactions. Though most available thermodynamic values were determined under acidic conditions, these models satisfactorily explained high-pH undersaturation solubility of technetium for citrate and NTA, whereas experimental data for Tc(IV)-EDTA were highly overestimated. This work illustrates the predominance of hydrolysis under hyperalkaline conditions and provides experimental support for existing thermodynamic models of Tc-L except Tc-EDTA, which requires further research regarding aqueous speciation and solubility."

In the case of salt-lake brines, however, the high feed salinity and low pH of the post-treated feed have an uncertain impact on nanofiltration's selectivity. Here, we adopt experimental and computational approaches to analyze the effect of pH and feed salinity and elucidate key selectivity mechanisms. Our data set comprises over 750 original ion rejection measurements, spanning five salinities and two pH levels, collected using brine solutions that model three salt lake compositions. Our results demonstrate that the Li+/Mg2+ selectivity of polyamide membranes can be enhanced by 13 times with acid-pretreated feed solutions. This selectivity enhancement is attributed to the amplified Donnan potential from the ionization of carboxyl and amino moieties under low solution pH. As feed salinities increase from 10 to 250 g L-1, the Li+/Mg2+ selectivity decreases by similar to 43%, a consequence of weakening exclusion mechanisms. Further, our analysis accentuates the importance of measuring separation factors using representative solution compositions to replicate the ion-transport behaviors with salt-lake brine. Consequently, our results reveal that predictions of ion rejection and Li+/Mg2+ separation factors can be improved by up to 80% when feed solutions with the appropriate Cl-/SO42- molar ratios are used."

Coastal waters along Tijuana, Mexico, and Imperial Beach (IB), USA, are frequently polluted by millions of gallons of untreated sewage and stormwater runoff. Entering coastal waters causes over 100 million global annual illnesses, but CWP has the potential to reach many more people on land via transfer in sea spray aerosol (SSA). Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we found sewage-associated bacteria in the polluted Tijuana River flowing into coastal waters and returning to land in marine aerosol. Tentative chemical identification from non-targeted tandem mass spectrometry identified anthropogenic compounds as chemical indicators of aerosolized CWP, but they were ubiquitous and present at highest concentrations in continental aerosol. Bacteria were better tracers of airborne CWP, and 40 tracer bacteria comprised up to 76% of the bacteria community in IB air. These findings confirm that CWP transfers in SSA and exposes many people along the coast. Climate change may exacerbate CWP with more extreme storms, and our findings call for minimizing CWP and investigating the health effects of airborne exposure."

REE (based on dry weight) were measured in sediments, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and organisms from different trophic levels. The highest n-ary sumation REE concentrations were measured in sediments (180 & PLUSMN; 4.24 mg kg-1) and SPM (163 & PLUSMN; 12.6 mg kg-1). Phytoplankton (45.7 & PLUSMN; 5.31 mg kg-1), periphyton (51.6 & PLUSMN; 1.81 mg kg-1), and zooplankton (68.5 & PLUSMN; 1.27 mg kg-1) are the major sources of exposure and transfer of REE to the food web. REE concentrations were several orders of magnitude lower in bivalves, crustaceans, and fish (6.01 & PLUSMN; 0.11, 1.22 & PLUSMN; 0.18, and 0.059 & PLUSMN; 0.003 mg kg-1, respectively) than in plankton. The n-ary sumation REE declined as a function of the trophic position, as determined by functional feeding groups and delta 15N, indicating that REE were subject to trophic dilution. Our study suggests that the consumption of seafood is unlikely to be an important source of REE for humans. However, given the numerous sources of dietary introduction of REE, they should be monitored for a possible harmful cumulative effect. This study provides new key information on REE's baseline concentrations and trophic transfers and patterns."	"[Santos, Ana C. S.

Hydrogen (H2) is one of the most energetic substrates in such environments, and many microorganisms are able to oxidize H2, potentially leading to loss of H2 or other unwanted reactions like production of, e.g., H2S, clogging, or corrosion. This study addressed the potential of H2 consumption by naturally abundant microorganisms in formation fluid from a gas field at near in situ pressure and temperature conditions. Microbial H2 consumption was evident at ambient and 100 bar and tolerated pressure variations reflecting cycles of H2 storage. Temperature strongly influenced the activity with higher activity at 30 degrees C but lower activity at 60 degrees C. The activity was sulfate-dependent, and sulfide was produced. The microbial community composition changed during H2 consumption with an increase in sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP). Thus, the presence of an SRP-containing, H2-consuming microbial community with activity at UHS-relevant pressure and temperature conditions was shown and should be taken into account when planning UHS at this and other sites."

These pollutants can interact with oxidants in both the aerosol and deposited forms. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a strong oxidant emitted during cleaning with chlorine-cleaning agents such as bleach, can attain mixing ratios of hundreds of ppbv indoors; moreover, lower mixing ratios are naturally present outdoors. Here, we report the heterogeneous reactivity of HOCl with wood smoke aerosol particles. After exposure to gas-phase HOCl, the particle chlorine content increased reaching chlorine-to-organic mass ratios of 0.07 with the chlorine covalently bound as organochlorine species, many of which are aromatic. Investigating individual potential BB components, we observed that unsaturated species such as coniferaldehyde and furfural react efficiently with HOCl. These observations indicate that organochlorine pollutants will form indoors when bleach cleaning a wildfire impacted space. The chlorine component of particles internally mixed with BB material and chloride initially increased, upon HOCl exposure, indicating that active chlorine recycling in the outdoor environment will be suppressed in the presence of BB emissions."

This analysis examines decarbonization opportunities for U.S. refineries and the cost to achieve both refinery level and complete life-cycle CO2 emission reductions. We used 2019 life-cycle CO2 emissions from U.S. refineries as a baseline and identified three categories of decarbonization opportunity: (1) switching refinery energy inputs from fossil to renewable sources (e.g., switch hydrogen source); (2) carbon capture and storage of CO2 from various refining units; and (3) changing the feedstock from petroleum crude to biocrude using various blending levels. While all three options can reduce CO2 emissions from refineries, only the third can reduce emissions throughout the life cycle of refinery products, including the combustion of fuels (e.g., gasoline and diesel) during end use applications. A decarbonization approach that combines strategies 1, 2, and 3 can achieve negative life-cycle CO2 emissions, with an average CO2 avoidance cost of $113-$477/MT CO2, or $54-$227/bbl of processed crude; these costs are driven primarily by the high cost of biocrude feedstock."

Fires in traction batteries can be difficult to extinguish because the battery cells are well protected and hard to reach. To control the fire, firefighters must prolong the application of extinguishing media. In this work, extinguishing water from three vehicles and one battery pack fire test were analyzed for inorganic and organic pollutants, including particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soot content. Additionally, the acute toxicity of the collected extinguishing water on three aquatic species was determined. The vehicles used in the fire tests were both conventional petrol-fueled and battery electric. For all of the tests, the analysis of the extinguishing water showed high toxicity toward the tested aquatic species. Several metals and ions were found in concentrations above the corresponding surface water guideline values. Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances were detected in concentrations ranging between 200 and 1400 ng L-1. Flushing the battery increased the concentration of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances to 4700 ng L-1. Extinguishing water from the battery electric vehicle and the battery pack contained a higher concentration of nickel, cobalt, lithium, manganese, and fluoride compared with the water samples analyzed from the conventional vehicle."

However, the pathogenic mechanism(s) of SOAs are still poorly understood. Herein, we show that chronic exposure of mice to SOAs resulted in lung inflammation and tissue destruction. Histological analyses found lung airspace enlargement associated with massive inflammatory cell recruitment predominated by macrophages. Concomitant with such cell influx, our results found changes in the levels of a series of inflammatory mediators in response to SOA. Interestingly, we observed that the expression of the genes encoding for TNF-alpha and IL-6 increased significantly after one month of exposure to SOAs; mediators that have been largely documented to play a role in chronic pulmonary inflammatory pathologies. Cell culture studies confirmed these in vivo findings. Of importance as well, our study indicates increased matrix metalloproteinase proteolytic activity suggesting its contribution to lung tissue inflammation and degradation. Our work represents the first in vivo study, which reports that chronic exposure to SOAs leads to lung inflammation and tissue injury.

Low soil moisture has marked impacts on the physiology of soil invertebrates and lowers degradation rates of organic contaminants in soil. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are hydrophobic contaminants that readily accumulate in the lipids of soil organisms. Here, we exposed springtails (Collembola, small soil living arthropods) to phenanthrene (a common PAH) in combination with a range of soil water contents to investigate the combined effects of these factors on the bioaccumulation, survival, recruitment, and body growth in a full factorial experiment. The results showed that phenanthrene up to 60 mg/ kg dry soil had moderate effects on survival (<20%), whereas dry soil (4% soil water content) caused approximately 60% mortality. The bioaccumulation of phenanthrene increased almost 3-fold when soil water content decreased from 22 to 4%. We observed a joint effect of low soil water content and phenanthrene on recruitment, suggesting a synergistic interaction. The recruitment EC50 values of phenanthrene decreased from approximately 40 mg/kg dry soil at 22% soil water content to approximately 10 mg/kg dry soil at 12% soil water content. Our results show that the effects of phenanthrene are more pronounced in dry soil partly because bioaccumulation is enhanced when soils become dry."

Depleted gas reservoirs appear suitable, but at the same time, they may be environments with potentially high microbial abundances and activities. Hydrogen (H2) is one of the most energetic substrates in such environments, and many microorganisms are able to oxidize H2, potentially leading to loss of H2 or other unwanted reactions like production of, e.g., H2S, clogging, or corrosion. This study addressed the potential of H2 consumption by naturally abundant microorganisms in formation fluid from a gas field at near in situ pressure and temperature conditions. Microbial H2 consumption was evident at ambient and 100 bar and tolerated pressure variations reflecting cycles of H2 storage. Temperature strongly influenced the activity with higher activity at 30 degrees C but lower activity at 60 degrees C. The activity was sulfate-dependent, and sulfide was produced. The microbial community composition changed during H2 consumption with an increase in sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP). Thus, the presence of an SRP-containing, H2-consuming microbial community with activity at UHS-relevant pressure and temperature conditions was shown and should be taken into account when planning UHS at this and other sites."

Therefore, we may miss important stressor interaction patterns and have poor knowledge on how pollutants affect thermal performance curves (TPCs), which is needed to improve insights into the fate of populations to warming in a polluted world. We tested the single and combined effects of pesticide exposure and DTFs on the TPCs of low- and high-latitude populations of Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae. While chlorpyrifos did not have any effect at the intermediate mean temperatures (20-24 ?), it became toxic (reflecting synergisms) at lower (<= 16 ?, reduced growth) and especially at higher (>= 28 ?, reduced survival and growth) mean temperatures, resulting in more concave-shaped TPCs. Remarkably, these toxicity patterns were largely consistent at both latitudes and hence across a natural thermal gradient. Moreover, DTFs magnified the pesticideinduced survival reductions at 34 ?. The TPC perspective allowed us to identify different toxicity patterns and interaction types (mainly additive vs synergistic) across the thermal gradient. This highlights the importance of using thermal gradients to make more realistic predictions about the impact of pesticides in a warming world and of warming in a polluted world."

While global inventories of the use and emissions of PCBs have been developed, estimates for individual countries determined using bottom-up approaches are few and often show different trends from the global inventory. Here, we determine the past, present, and future consumption and emissions of PCBs in India. A mass balance model was used to estimate middle (low-high) emissions in the period 1950-2100. Up to 7296 tonnes of PCBs have been used in transformers. PCBs imported as wastes are estimated to be approximately 5000 (2400-9100) tonnes. Total emissions from the use and disposal of transformers, industrial processes, and imported waste disposal are estimated to become 13 (0.1-537) tonnes, 89.26 (0.5-178) tonnes, 63 (3-910) tonnes, respectively, in the period 1950-2100. Congener-specific emissions are relatively high for low-chlorinated PCBs (-8, 18, 28, 31, 52, 101, 110, 118, 153, range: 0.1-118 tonnes). We find that industrial emissions are becoming important sources of PCBs and may become predominant, depending on emission scenarios.

A common wisdom is that rougher membranes tend to experience more severe fouling. In this study, we compared the fouling behaviors of a smooth polyamide membrane (RO-s) and a nanovoid-containing rough polyamide membrane (RO-r). Contrary to the traditional belief, we observed more severe fouling for RO-s, which can be ascribed to its uneven flux distribution caused by the funnel effect. Additional tracer filtration tests using gold nanoparticles revealed a more patchlike particle deposition pattern, confirming the adverse impact of funnel effect on membrane water transport. In contrast, the experimentally observed lower fouling propensity of the nanovoid-containing rough membrane can be explained by: (1) the weakened funnel effect thanks to the presence of nanovoids, which can regulate the water transport pathway through the membrane and (2) the decreased average localized flux over the membrane surface due to the increased effective filtration area for the nanovoid-induced roughness features. The current study provides fundamental insights into the critical role of surface roughness in membrane fouling, which may have important implications for the future development of high-performance antifouling membranes."

Fires in traction batteries can be difficult to extinguish because the battery cells are well protected and hard to reach. To control the fire, firefighters must prolong the application of extinguishing media. In this work, extinguishing water from three vehicles and one battery pack fire test were analyzed for inorganic and organic pollutants, including particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soot content. Additionally, the acute toxicity of the collected extinguishing water on three aquatic species was determined. The vehicles used in the fire tests were both conventional petrol-fueled and battery electric. For all of the tests, the analysis of the extinguishing water showed high toxicity toward the tested aquatic species. Several metals and ions were found in concentrations above the corresponding surface water guideline values. Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances were detected in concentrations ranging between 200 and 1400 ng L-1. Flushing the battery increased the concentration of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances to 4700 ng L-1.

Methane venting from single-well CHOPS facilities in Saskatchewan, Canada was measured (i) using Bridger Photonics' airborne Gas Mapping LiDAR (GML) at 962 sites and (ii) on-site using an optical mass flux meter (VentX), ultrasonic flow meter, and QOGI camera at 11 sites. The strong correlation between ground measurements and airborne GML supported subsequent detailed analysis of the aerial data and to our knowledge is the first study to directly test the ability of airplane surveys to accurately reproduce mean emission rates of unsteady sources. Actual methane venting was found to be nearly four times greater than the industry-reported levels used in emission inventories, with similar to 80% of all emissions attributed to casing gas venting. Further analysis of site-total emissions revealed potential gaps in regulations, with 14% of sites appearing to exceed regulated limits while accounting for 61% of measured methane emissions. Finally, the concept of marginal wells was adapted to consider the inferred cost of methane emissions under current carbon pricing. Results suggest that almost a third of all methane is emitted from environmentally marginal wells, where the inferred methane cost negates the value of the oil produced. Overall, the present results illustrate the importance of independent monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) to ensure accuracy in reporting and regulatory compliance, and to ensure mitigation targets are not foiled by a collection of disproportionately high-emitting sites."

However, few large-scale cohort studies have comprehensively estimated the association between EDCs exposure and mortality risk. This study aimed to investigate the association of urinary EDCs exposure with mortality risk and quantify attributable mortality and economic loss. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to investigate the association of 38 representative EDCs exposure with mortality risk in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). During a median follow-up of 7.7 years, 47,279 individuals were enrolled. All-cause mortality was positively associated with 1-hydroxynaph-thalene, 2-hydroxynaphthalene, cadmium, antimony, cobalt, and monobenzyl phthalate. Cancer mortality was positively associated with cadmium. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality was positively associated with 1-hydroxynaphthalene, 2-hydroxynaph-thalene, and 2-hydroxyfluorene. Nonlinear U-shaped relationships were found between all-cause mortality and cadmium and cobalt, which was also identified between 2-hydroxyfluorene and CVD mortality. J-shaped association of cadmium exposure with cancer mortality was also determined. EDCs exposure may cause 56.52% of total deaths (1,528,500 deaths) and around 1,897 billion USD in economic costs. Exposure to certain phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phytoestrogens, or toxic metals, even at substantially low levels, is significantly associated with mortality and induces high economic costs."

While global inventories of the use and emissions of PCBs have been developed, estimates for individual countries determined using bottom-up approaches are few and often show different trends from the global inventory. Here, we determine the past, present, and future consumption and emissions of PCBs in India. A mass balance model was used to estimate middle (low-high) emissions in the period 1950-2100. Up to 7296 tonnes of PCBs have been used in transformers. PCBs imported as wastes are estimated to be approximately 5000 (2400-9100) tonnes. Total emissions from the use and disposal of transformers, industrial processes, and imported waste disposal are estimated to become 13 (0.1-537) tonnes, 89.26 (0.5-178) tonnes, 63 (3-910) tonnes, respectively, in the period 1950-2100. Congener-specific emissions are relatively high for low-chlorinated PCBs (-8, 18, 28, 31, 52, 101, 110, 118, 153, range: 0.1-118 tonnes).

However, there is no research on the crosstalk mechanism between necroptosis and macrophage extracellular traps (METs) after 1,4 NQ-BC exposure. In this study, we treated RAW264.7 cells with 50, 100, and 200 mg/L 1,4 NQ-BC for 24 h, with 10 mu M necrostatin-1 for 24 h, and with 2.5 mu M phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 3 h. Our experiment revealed that under normal physiological conditions, when macrophages receive external stimuli (such as pathogens; in this experiment, PMA), they will form METs and capture and kill pathogens, thus exerting innate immune function. However, exposure to 1,4 NQ-BC can cause necroptosis in macrophages, accompanied by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytosolic calcium ions, as well as the expression disorder of inflammatory factors and chemokines, prevent the formation of METs, lead to loss of the function of capturing and killing pathogens, and weaken the innate immune function. Notably, inhibition of necroptosis restored the formation of METs, indicating that necroptosis inhibited the formation of METs. Our study was the first to explore the crosstalk mechanism between necroptosis and METs. This experiment will enrich the mechanism of macrophage injury caused by 1,4 NQ-BC exposure."

The method was applied to raw and produced drinking water from 18 Dutch locations, including groundwater or surface water as source, and applied various treatment processes. Ultrashort-chain (300 to 1100 ng/L) followed by the group of perfluoroalkyl-carboxylic-acids (PFCA, >= C4) (0.4 to 95.1 ng/L) were dominant. PFCA and perfluoroalkyl-sulfonic-acid (>= C4), including precursors, showed significantly higher levels in drinking water produced from surface water. However, no significant difference was found for ultrashort PFAS, indicating the need for groundwater protection. Negative removal of PFAS occasionally observed for advanced treatment indicates desorption and/or degradation of precursors. The proportion of branched isomers was higher in raw and produced drinking water as compared to industrial production.

However, these emerging contaminants are increasingly disseminated into ecosystems, raising concern regarding their toxicity. REE-accumulating plants are crucial subjects to better understand REE transfer to the trophic chain but are also promising phytoremediation tools. In this analysis, we deciphered REE accumulation sites in the REE-accumulating fern Dryopteris erythrosora by synchrotron X-ray mu fluorescence (mu XRF). This technique allows a high-resolution and in situ analysis of fresh samples or frozen-hydrated cross sections of different organs of the plant. In the sporophyte, REEs were translocated from the roots to the fronds by the xylem sap and were stored within the xylem conductive system. The comparison of REE distribution and accumulation levels in the healthy and necrotic parts of the frond shed light on the differential mobility between light and heavy REEs. Furthermore, the comparison emphasized that necrotized areas were not the main REE-accumulating sites. Finally, the absence of cell-to-cell mobility of REEs in the gametophyte suggested the absence of REE-compatible transporters in photosynthetic tissues. These results provide valuable knowledge on the physiology of REE-accumulating ferns to understand the REE cycle in biological systems and the expansion of phytotechnologies for REE-enriched or REE-contaminated soils."

Diseases such as fungal pathogens cause costly algal feedstock crashes, but the life cycle assessments (LCAs) used to analyze the viability of algal feedstocks for biofuel have yet to consider the impact of disease on life cycle metrics. Here, we incorporate a disease model into a well-documented LCA for algal biorefineries to compare two sustainability metrics, energy return on investment (EROI) and global warming potential (GWP). We begin by showing that failure to consider disease leads to overly optimistic LCA metric outputs. Then, we compare two leading control strategies of disease-chemical and biological. Our analyses show that biological engineering of a multispecies consortium of algae has a greater positive impact on LCA metrics than chemical control of the fungal pathogen using a fungicide. We expand how and when bi-cultures might advantageously exhibit the dilution effect whereby differentially susceptible species exhibit compensatory dynamics that stabilize feedstock production. Our results emphasize the impact of disease and suggest that multispecies consortia of algae can be biologically engineered to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the economic viability of biofuel."

This study explored the applicability of wastewater surveillance for C. auris in a metropolitan area with reported outbreaks across multiple healthcare facilities. Influent or primary effluent samples were collected over 10 weeks from seven sewersheds in Southern Nevada. Pelleted solids were analyzed using an adapted quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay targeting the ITS2 region of the C. auris genome. Positive detection was observed in 72 of 91 samples (79%), with higher detection frequencies in sewersheds serving healthcare facilities involved in the outbreak (94 vs 20% sample positivity). Influent wastewater concentrations ranged from 2.8 to 5.7 log10 gene copies per liter (gc/L), and primary clarification achieved an average log reduction value (LRV) of 1.24 +/- 0.34. Presumptive negative surface water and wastewater controls were non-detect. These results demonstrate that wastewater surveillance may assist in tracking the spread of C. auris and serve as an early warning tool for public health action.

Eleven solutions were tested, including point sensor networks and scanning/imaging solutions. Results indicated a 90% probability of detection (POD) of 3-30 kg CH4/h; 6 of 11 solutions achieved a POD < 6 kg CH4/h, although uncertainty was high. Four had true positive rates > 50%. False positive rates ranged from 0 to 79%. Six solutions estimated emission rates. For a release rate of 0.1-1 kg/h, the solutions' mean relative errors ranged from -44% to +586% with single estimates between -97% and +2077%, and 4 solutions' upper uncertainty exceeding +900%. Above 1 kg/h, mean relative error was -40% to +93%, with two solutions within +/- 20%, and single-estimate relative errors were from -82% to +448%.

The limit of detection (LOD) ranged from 0.009 to 0.1 ng/L, except for trifluoroacetic-acid and perfluoropropanoic-acid with higher LODs of 35 and 0.24 ng/L, respectively. The method was applied to raw and produced drinking water from 18 Dutch locations, including groundwater or surface water as source, and applied various treatment processes. Ultrashort-chain (300 to 1100 ng/L) followed by the group of perfluoroalkyl-carboxylic-acids (PFCA, >= C4) (0.4 to 95.1 ng/L) were dominant. PFCA and perfluoroalkyl-sulfonic-acid (>= C4), including precursors, showed significantly higher levels in drinking water produced from surface water. However, no significant difference was found for ultrashort PFAS, indicating the need for groundwater protection. Negative removal of PFAS occasionally observed for advanced treatment indicates desorption and/or degradation of precursors. The proportion of branched isomers was higher in raw and produced drinking water as compared to industrial production.

Measurements were performed in British Columbia, Canada, an active oil-and gas-producing province with modern methane regulations featuring mandatory three times per year leak detection and repair (LDAR) surveys at most facilities. Derived emission factors enabled by source attribution show that significant methane emissions persist under this regulatory framework, dominated by (i) combustion slip (compressor exhaust and also catalytic heaters, which are not covered in current regulations), (ii) intentional venting (uncontrolled tanks, vent stacks or intentionally unlit flares, and uncontrolled compressors), and (iii) unintentional venting (controlled tanks, unintentionally unlit/ blown out flares, and abnormally operating pneumatics). Although the detailed analysis shows mitigation options exist for all sources, the importance of combustion slip and the persistently large methane contributions from controlled tanks and unlit flares demonstrate the limits of current LDAR programs and the critical need for additional monitoring and verification if regulations are to have the intended impacts, and reduction targets of 75% and greater are to be met."
